The archaeologist returned to Fragment 2749-A demanding proof that she was actually being watched from the future.
The authentication markers displayed unchanged. 847.3 terabytes. Memory integrity 94.7%. Neural pathway preservation 91.2%. Temporal consistency 88.9%. The fragment she had certified twenty-three days earlier remained stable in archive—crystalline substrate maintaining perfect fidelity, consciousness preserved at moment of death in 2041, data structures intact.
She knew the preservation was genuine. She also knew preservation didn't explain the sensation she couldn't dismiss.
During her previous examination, she had felt observed. Not by present surveillance, not by colleagues, not by anything she could locate in three-dimensional space. The sensation had been strange, persistent—attention from somewhere else, somewhen else. Future observation reaching backward through time. And specifically: lonely attention. Desperate-quiet watching from someone who hadn't seen another person in so long that observing her work felt like connection.
But feeling watched didn't prove she was watched. Sensations weren't evidence. The impression of future attention could be neural interface artifact, could be projection from exhaustion, could be her mind interpreting random neural noise as meaningful pattern.
She needed verification. Not subjective experience of being observed. Objective proof that temporal observation was actually occurring, that someone in the future was genuinely accessing this moment, that the sensation had external cause rather than internal origin.
She initiated Test 1: Access Pattern Analysis. If future readers were examining this fragment, they would leave traces—read patterns, attention markers, access timestamps from dates that hadn't occurred yet. She searched the fragment's metadata for temporal anomalies.
The metadata showed her own access from twenty-three days prior. Showed current session. Showed standard archive maintenance protocols. No future timestamps. No impossible access dates. No proof that anyone from 2383 or any other future year had read this fragment.
But absence of future timestamps didn't prove absence of future reading. The metadata system might not be designed to record temporal paradoxes. Future access might not leave marks detectable by present investigation. The sensation could still be real even if verification protocols couldn't capture it.
Test 1 failed to prove or disprove anything.
She tried Test 2: Neural Interface Resonance Detection. The sensation of being watched had physical quality—pressure at awareness edge, weight without location. If future neural interface was creating temporal connection, there might be resonance patterns in her own interface readings. Electromagnetic signatures. Quantum entanglement traces. Something measurable that would confirm attention was coming from outside her perception.
She examined her interface logs. Standard neural crown activity—her brain patterns, her attention allocation, her cognitive processing distributed across interface architecture. Nothing anomalous. No resonance from external source. No signatures suggesting temporal connection to future observation.
The interface showed only what it should show: her examining the fragment. No evidence of anyone examining her.
But evidence absence wasn't evidence of absence. Her interface might not be sensitive enough to detect temporal observation. Future neural technology might operate on principles her present equipment couldn't measure. The sensation could be genuine even if her tools couldn't verify it.
Test 2 documented normal interface function. It didn't prove she wasn't being watched.
She escalated to Test 3: Causality Verification. If someone in the future was reading this moment, there should be causal connection—something about her current examination that anticipated or prepared for future reading. Documentation structured for not-yet-present observers. Attention patterns that assumed witness. Examination behavior modified by awareness of being watched.
She reviewed her authentication from twenty-three days prior. She had worked methodically, professionally, followed standard protocols. Nothing in her behavior suggested anticipation of future readers. No evidence she had structured her work for temporal audience. Her examination had been entirely present-focused.
Except. There had been that moment when she'd paused. When the sensation of being watched had been strongest. When she'd written in her notes: "Future attention acknowledged." Not standard documentation language. Not professional protocol. A message to hypothetical future reader that shouldn't exist if she truly believed no one was reading.
But one anomalous note wasn't proof. It could be her documenting the sensation itself rather than responding to genuine observation. Could be artifact of momentary disorientation rather than evidence of temporal connection. Could mean nothing beyond her own uncertainty about what she was experiencing.
Test 3 revealed ambiguity. It didn't resolve that ambiguity.
She sat at her workstation, neural interface active, Fragment 2749-A loaded, and recognized the verification problem. Temporal observation—if real—occurred across time rather than within testable present. Any evidence she could examine existed in her timeline. Any proof she could access was constrained by causality that future-to-past attention would violate. Her verification protocols operated within temporal sequence. What she was trying to verify transcended that sequence.
How could she prove someone from 2383 was watching her? They hadn't been born yet. Their technology didn't exist. Their consciousness—if preserved, if accessing archives, if capable of temporal observation—existed in future she couldn't reach or test or verify.
The verification paradox was emerging: proving temporal observation required detecting effects of future cause, but her methodology could only examine present evidence. She needed to verify phenomenon that, by definition, wouldn't leave marks her present investigation could recognize.
She felt watched even now. The sensation persisted despite failed verification. Lonely attention from impossible future, observing her attempt to prove that observation impossible.
Maybe the sensation was real. Maybe it was projection. Maybe reality and projection were indistinguishable when dealing with phenomena that transcended ordinary causality.
She couldn't prove future attention existed. She couldn't prove it didn't exist. The fragment contained preserved consciousness from 2041. Her examination occurred in 2047. The sensation suggested observation from 2383. Temporal architecture that verification protocols weren't designed to test.
She saved her failed verification attempts. Documented three tests that proved nothing. Made notes for additional approaches—quantum entanglement examination, consciousness continuity analysis, temporal causality mapping. Tests she would run next time. Tests that would probably fail to verify what might be unverifiable.
The fragment remained stable. 847.3 terabytes of preserved consciousness that might be observed by future that might not exist in testable form.
She certified the fragment again. Not because verification succeeded. Because authentication required certification regardless of what couldn't be proven.
Fragment 2749-A: Temporal consistency 88.9%. Consistent with preservation standards that didn't account for temporal observation from outside preservation timeline.
The sensation of being watched continued. Proof remained impossible. Work continued anyway.
She logged her examination. Made no mention in official records of unprovable future attention. Professional documentation couldn't include what professional methodology couldn't verify.
The fragment waited in archive. Future readers might access it. She couldn't prove they would or wouldn't.
The verification had failed. The sensation persisted. The boundary between real temporal observation and imagined temporal observation remained undetectable.
She couldn't distinguish between possibilities that her present position made indistinguishable.
