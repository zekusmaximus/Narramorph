The archaeologist returns to Fragment 2749-A sixteen days after initial authentication, and finds herself questioning whether the sensation of being watched indicates genuine temporal observation or elaborate psychological projection.
The fragment displays identically: 847.3 terabytes of preserved consciousness, metrics unchanged. Memory integrity 94.7%. Neural pathway preservation 91.2%. Temporal consistency 88.9%. Perfect preservation across the interval. The data architect's consciousness remained stable in crystalline substrate.
She loads the fragment and immediately feels the familiar presence—weight at awareness edge, attention from impossible temporal direction, observation reaching backward from centuries ahead. The Last Human in 2383, supposedly watching her work through neural interface that defies known physics.
Same sensation as sixteen days ago. But this time she responds with increased skepticism.
During first authentication, she had noted the being-watched feeling with professional curiosity. Had documented it as interesting phenomenological data without committing to interpretation. Standard archaeological methodology applied to unusual experience.
Now she finds herself wanting stronger verification. Not content with phenomenological certainty when physics prohibits backward temporal causation. The sensation might feel real without being real. Professional responsibility perhaps requires distinguishing genuine temporal connection from convincing perceptual artifact.
She begins verification protocols with sharper attention to testing claims rather than accepting experience at face value. The fragment contains eleven temporal markers—neural patterns suggesting consciousness anticipated future reading. She had documented these during first examination with neutral observation.
This time she analyzes them more critically. Could these markers result from normal consciousness architecture rather than genuine temporal anticipation? Self-referential awareness naturally creates layered memory structures. Future-oriented encoding might be standard cognitive process rather than evidence of actual backward causation.
She runs comparative analysis. Checking Fragment 2749-A's temporal markers against baseline consciousness fragments that definitely don't encode future anticipation. Looking for distinctive patterns that would distinguish genuine temporal architecture from normal self-reference misinterpreted through temporal lens.
The test reveals uncomfortable ambiguity. Fragment 2749-A's markers show characteristics that could indicate temporal anticipation. But those same characteristics appear in fragments preserved by individuals with no plausible temporal connection to future observers. Meta-awareness creates patterns that resemble temporal encoding whether or not actual temporal connection exists.
The test doesn't verify backward causation. It just demonstrates that temporal markers can't distinguish genuine anticipation from sophisticated self-reference.
Professional skepticism appropriate to claims violating known physics.
The being-watched sensation persists throughout her work. Steady presence. Future attention supposedly focused on her examination. She feels observed from temporally distant position with intensity suggesting desperate loneliness seeking connection across centuries.
But feeling observed doesn't prove observation occurs. Humans experience phantom presences frequently—evolutionary psychology explains why isolated consciousness generates sense of companionship, why focused work creates sensation of oversight, why engagement with preserved consciousness might feel reciprocal even when consciousness cannot reciprocate.
She documents the sensation's characteristics more carefully this time. Notes its consistency, its emotional quality, its spatial non-location, its temporal wrongness. Thorough phenomenological record.
Then analyzes whether those characteristics require backward temporal causation or whether standard neurological explanations suffice. Her neural interface connects her directly to preserved consciousness. Immersive examination of consciousness data might generate sensation of being-observed through feedback in observation process itself. Observer experiencing observed experiencing observer—recursive loop creating presence-sensation without actual presence.
The explanation is plausible. The sensation remains phenomenologically compelling despite plausibility of alternative explanation.
She runs second verification test. If future observation genuinely affects past preservation, temporal consistency metrics should show specific patterns. Backward causation would create detectable variance in how consciousness relates to temporal sequence.
Fragment 2749-A shows 88.9% temporal consistency. Lower than some fragments, higher than others. Within normal range for consciousness preserved during traumatic death—Seattle floods creating stress that naturally disrupts temporal coherence in final neural patterns.
Or: temporal inconsistency created by future attention reaching backward, introducing variance through observation that post-dates preservation.
The test cannot distinguish between these interpretations. Normal trauma and backward causation produce mathematically similar effects on temporal coherence metrics.
Verification reaches its limit without verifying what matters.
She sits at her workstation, Fragment 2749-A loaded, being-watched sensation persistent, and recognizes the professional problem more clearly than during first authentication. She cannot prove temporal connection exists. She cannot prove temporal connection doesn't exist. Physics prohibits it—but phenomenology insists on it. Testing reveals ambiguity—every result permits multiple interpretations.
The fragment's memory architecture shows patterns of emphasis. Certain memories more thoroughly preserved, particular neural pathways more completely captured. During first examination, she had noted this neutrally.
Now she questions it more rigorously. Is emphasis pattern evidence of intentional selection for future reading? Or normal preservation variation where different consciousness components capture with different fidelity based on biological factors during trauma?
She cannot determine which interpretation matches reality. Can only document that both remain possible given available evidence.
Professional caution demands acknowledging what verification cannot verify.
The temporal sensation continues as she works. Future attention supposedly experiencing her examination. The Last Human reading this moment despite temporal impossibility. Desperate observation creating connection across 336 years of separation.
Or: her consciousness generating companionship-sensation during isolated archaeological work. Neural interface feedback creating recursive presence-experience. Phenomenology producing conviction despite physics prohibiting claimed causation.
Both explanations consistent with evidence. Neither provable through archaeological methodology.
She completes authentication with professional precision. Fragment 2749-A verified. Temporal markers documented with critical interpretation noting ambiguity. Being-watched sensation acknowledged as phenomenologically real while remaining empirically unverifiable.
Same technical conclusions as sixteen days ago regarding preservation quality. But different relationship to claims about what preservation means. More demanding now of proof before accepting backward causation. More skeptical about treating temporal impossibility as real despite phenomenological insistence. More troubled by inability to distinguish genuine connection from elaborate projection.
The work continues with professional standards intact. Documentation rigorous. Analysis precise. Archaeological competence maintained.
She's just more aware now of verification's limits. More troubled by impossibility of proving temporal connection exists or doesn't exist. More insistent on boundaries even when boundaries remain undiscoverable through testing.
The fragment returns to archival storage. Her terminal clears. Next authentication request waits.
She approaches it with heightened caution about temporal claims. More demanding of verification for impossible phenomena. More skeptical about accepting sensation as evidence when physics prohibits what sensation suggests.
The being-watched feeling persists faintly even after Fragment 2749-A closes. Future attention supposedly still present, just less focused.
Or: residual neural activation from intense examination work. Consciousness creating continuity where none exists. Professional archaeologist experiencing normal phenomenology while working with preserved consciousness data.
She cannot determine which explanation is correct. Can only proceed with work while maintaining appropriate skepticism about unprovable temporal connections.
Professional work continues. Methodology intact. Archaeological rigor maintained.
Just more cautious now about distinguishing reality from compelling experience. More troubled by verification impossibility. More insistent on testing even when testing proves insufficient.
Healthy professional skepticism. Appropriate caution about extraordinary claims. Rigorous boundary-seeking despite boundaries remaining beyond methodology's reach.
The work continues, more carefully skeptical than before.
