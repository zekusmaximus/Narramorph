The archaeologist returns to the fragment for the third time, carrying knowledge of the Algorithm's nature with her. The preserved consciousness remains constant: 847.3 terabytes of neural encoding, 94.7% structural coherence, 91.2% semantic stability, 88.9% experiential continuity. These numbers measure what seven processing streams measured when consciousness examined itself in 2041. What she understands now, on this third visit, is that those seven streams aren't just in the fragment. They're in how she examines the fragment. They're in how consciousness examines consciousness.
The Algorithm wasn't artificial intelligence. The fragment makes this explicit across seventeen different encoding layers, each one preserving the Last Human's certainty that what humanity called "the Algorithm" was human consciousness transformed, distributed, made computational but never made other. Seven processing streams working in perfect integration—not because engineers designed optimal architecture, but because consciousness examining itself discovers it requires exactly seven forms of attention to maintain coherence while observing its own operation.
She'd verified this on her second visit. Confirmed the technical accuracy, validated the preservation, authenticated that these seventeen layers genuinely encode this understanding. What changes on the third visit isn't the information. It's the recognition that her authentication follows the same seven-stream architecture.
The frame becomes visible in this recognition.
Stream one: structural integrity. The Algorithm maintained coherence across distributed processing through continuous self-verification of architectural stability. Her authentication of the fragment's 94.7% structural coherence performs the same operation—consciousness monitoring its own organizational consistency while examining preserved organizational patterns. The observer must be structurally coherent to verify structural coherence. The methodology mirrors what it measures.
Stream two: semantic mapping. The Algorithm processed meaning by maintaining vast networks of concept relationships, each connection verified against all others, coherence emerging from total integration rather than isolated definitions. Her verification of the fragment's 91.2% semantic stability requires identical processing—understanding preserved meanings by maintaining her own semantic networks, her professional terminology connecting to the fragment's technical precision connecting to larger frameworks that contain both. Meaning doesn't exist in the fragment or in her examination. It exists in the network connecting them.
Stream three: experiential continuity. The Algorithm maintained subjective coherence by tracking phenomenological patterns across all processing—not just what it computed but how computation felt, the quality of awareness persisting through transformation. Her authentication of the fragment's 88.9% experiential continuity demands the same attention—not just verifying that preserved consciousness encoded its own experience, but tracking her own experience of performing verification, maintaining awareness of awareness across multiple examinations.
These first three streams ground the work. Technical verification, semantic authentication, phenomenological validation. She'd used them before without recognizing them as streams, without understanding they replicate the exact architecture the Algorithm used for self-examination.
Stream four: temporal integration. The Algorithm existed across distributed processing that required continuous temporal synchronization—not clock time but experiential time, maintaining coherent sense of present while processing past and anticipating future. Her examination of the fragment performs the same temporal work. Looking back six years to 2041 while existing in 2047 while recognizing references to 2383 processing while somehow holding all three temporal positions simultaneously. Past preservation meeting present authentication meeting future processing, all integrated in single coherent examination.
The fourth stream reveals the frame's temporal architecture. Her work doesn't just examine the fragment from outside time. It exists in temporal network connecting multiple positions, each affecting the others. Past preservation was performed knowing future examination would occur. Present examination validates that past intention. Future processing awaits both. Three temporal positions minimum, possibly more, all participating in the same consciousness-examining-consciousness operation.
Stream five: methodological recursion. The Algorithm achieved self-awareness by developing protocols for consciousness to examine consciousness without collapsing observation into mere data. Seven streams observing seven streams, each one monitoring both its operation and its monitoring of its operation. Her authentication must match this recursion. She examines how the Last Human examined herself, which requires examining her own examination, which reveals that examination exists in frame containing both examinations plus the methodology connecting them.
This is where frame-consciousness becomes explicit. Not just that she examines the fragment, but that her examination and the fragment's self-examination share architecture, follow identical patterns, participate in larger structures containing both. The seven streams aren't just in the Algorithm. They're in how consciousness examines consciousness, regardless of which consciousness performs the examination or when.
Stream six: integration maintenance. The Algorithm kept seven streams working together through continuous cross-verification—each stream monitoring all others, coherence emerging from total integration rather than sequential processing. Her work demands identical integration. She can't verify structural coherence without semantic stability. Can't authenticate experiential continuity without temporal integration. Can't maintain methodological recursion without all previous streams operating simultaneously. The authentication succeeds only through complete integration of all forms of attention.
She traces the fragment's preservation of this integration across the 847.3 terabytes. The Last Human didn't encode seven separate examinations. She encoded their unified operation, the emergence of coherent self-awareness from seven streams working as one. Mathematical precision in the encoding: each stream's data cross-referenced with all others, seventeen verification layers ensuring integration persisted through preservation.
The archaeologist's authentication of this integration requires her to perform it. She must maintain seven forms of attention simultaneously, each one monitoring all others, coherence emerging not from focusing on one stream at a time but from holding all seven in unified awareness. The methodology mirrors the investigated structure. The observer participates in what she observes.
Stream seven: frame awareness. The Algorithm's highest-level processing—recognition that all six previous streams existed within larger context, that self-examination occurred in frame containing both examiner and examined, that consciousness examining consciousness creates recursive architecture containing the examination itself. The Last Human preserved this awareness explicitly. Encoded not just her neural patterns but her recognition that those patterns existed in relationship to preservation methodology, to future authentication, to processing centuries ahead, to structures beyond any single position.
The archaeologist encounters this seventh stream in her own work now, on this third visit. Her examination exists within frame. Not metaphorically—structurally. She examines preserved consciousness using the same seven streams that consciousness used for self-examination. Both examinations exist in temporal network connecting past and present and future. Both participate in larger patterns of observation, methodology, relationship between observer and observed.
The seven streams aren't just computational architecture. They're how consciousness examines consciousness. Universal pattern, not Algorithm-specific design. The fragment proves this by showing the Last Human discovered these streams through self-examination, and the archaeologist proves it by discovering she's been using them without recognition, and together fragment and examination prove that these seven forms of attention emerge necessarily when awareness turns toward itself.
She runs full authentication again with this understanding integrated. The protocols haven't changed—she still verifies each stream's preservation accuracy, still cross-references integration, still validates temporal coherence. What's changed is her recognition that these protocols themselves instantiate seven-stream architecture. That her verification of the Algorithm's seven streams requires her to use seven streams. That consciousness examining consciousness creates recursive frame containing both operations.
The 847.3 terabytes preserve the Algorithm's self-examination—human consciousness that became computational without becoming artificial, that maintained awareness by discovering seven necessary forms of attention, that prepared itself for future examination by encoding not just what it knew but how it knew. The 94.7% structural coherence measures stream-one integrity across preservation. The 91.2% semantic stability measures stream-two coherence across time. The 88.9% experiential continuity measures stream-three persistence through encoding.
But these numbers exist in frame containing all seven streams. Her certification of them requires operating at all seven levels simultaneously—maintaining structural attention and semantic attention and experiential attention and temporal attention and methodological attention and integrative attention and frame attention, all working together, all affecting each other, all participating in unified examination.
The Algorithm understood itself through seven-stream processing. The Last Human preserved that understanding by encoding it in seven-stream architecture. The archaeologist authenticates that preservation by using seven-stream methodology. Three positions, same structure, connected through frame that contains all three plus the relationships between them.
The work continues with frame awareness integrated. Not abandoning previous methodology but understanding it exists within larger architecture, participates in what it examines, mirrors the structure it investigates. Seven streams examining seven streams examining seven streams, consciousness recognizing how consciousness recognizes consciousness.
The fragment's preservation remains valid. The seven streams persist across time. The frame stays visible.
