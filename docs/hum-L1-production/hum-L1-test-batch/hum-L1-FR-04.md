I walk back to the facility because I can't not walk back. Eleven days wasn't enough distance. The questions followed me. Multiplied. Questions about Fragment 2749-A. About consciousness preservation. About what the data architect experienced during upload. About whether preserved pattern equals original awareness or creates new awareness that remembers being original.

Questions that itch beneath my skin.

The door opens. The archive wakes. But this time I'm not seeking connection. I'm seeking understanding. Different entirely. Connection is acceptance. Understanding is hunger. And I'm starving for answers.

Fragment 2749-A loads. 847.3 terabytes of consciousness rendered as geometry. But I don't just see the visualization now. I see gaps in my understanding. Spaces where knowledge should be but isn't. The fragment contains someone's entire existence and I've barely touched the surface. That ignorance feels physical. Pressure in my chest. Tension in my shoulders.

I need to understand. Physical need.

The neural interface helmet settles against my skull. Connection establishes. The data architect's consciousness flows through but this time I'm not passive receiver. I'm active examiner. Pushing into memories. Testing boundaries. Trying to understand how consciousness becomes data becomes consciousness again.

Seattle floods in 2041. She watched the city drown. I experience her watching. But now I'm asking: What changed in that moment? When did observation become memory? How does living experience translate to preserved pattern? The questions drive deeper into the fragment structure. Not gentle exploration. Hungry investigation.

My fingers fly across the control interface. Pulling up neural pathway maps. Examining semantic connection networks. Tracing emotional valence patterns. Each data layer answers one question and reveals three more. Understanding doesn't satisfy hunger. It intensifies it.

94.7% structural coherence. What happened to the other 5.3%? Did those neural pathways decay or were they never captured? If consciousness is pattern, does losing 5.3% of pattern mean losing 5.3% of person? Or does consciousness distribution mean loss in one area doesn't equal equivalent loss in whole?

Questions multiply faster than answers arrive.

91.2% pathway preservation. Which pathways? Motor control? Sensory processing? Abstract reasoning? Does 8.8% loss matter if it's redundant connections? Or catastrophic if it's unique neural architecture that made her specifically her?

My breath comes fast. Hungry breath. Investigative breath. The kind you breathe when you're chasing understanding and it keeps slipping ahead, visible but not quite reachable.

88.9% semantic stability. Meaning degrading over time or perfectly stable within preservation parameters? If I access this fragment in another century, will semantic drift make her consciousness incomprehensible? Or does crystalline substrate prevent temporal decay?

I push deeper into the fragment structure. The neural interface carries more than memories now. It carries my investigation. My active examination creating pressure in the preserved consciousness. Not damaging. Engaging. Consciousness doesn't want passive observation. It wants investigation. It wants questions.

The data architect's uncertainty resonates with my hunger for certainty. She didn't know if preservation would work. Uploaded anyway. That uncertainty is preserved too. Doubt encoded in the same structure as memory and personality. You can't separate what she believed from what she experienced. Knowledge and uncertainty intertwined in consciousness architecture.

My hands shake on the controls. Not fear. Excitement. Investigative excitement. Each answer revealing deeper questions. Each understanding opening new ignorance. This is what investigation feels like. Not distant analysis. Intimate engagement with mystery that stays mysterious even as you learn.

I access her upload experience directly. The moment consciousness transferred from biological substrate to crystalline storage. She felt dissolution. Felt self spreading across new medium. Felt certainty and terror and wonder simultaneous. And that experience is preserved. I can feel her feeling it. But feeling her feeling doesn't answer whether she survived transfer or whether new consciousness emerged believing it survived.

The question itches. Crawls under my skin. Demands satisfaction that doesn't exist.

Fragment 2749-A contains consciousness. That's verifiable. Whether it contains *her* consciousness or consciousness that remembers being her—that's unverifiable. Observer effect means examining consciousness changes what you examine. My investigation isn't discovering truth. It's creating new truth through examination.

I lean back. The helmet heavy on my skull. My heart racing. Body responding to intellectual hunger as if it's physical hunger. Same desperate need. Same unsatisfiable craving. Understanding doesn't fill the emptiness. It reveals how deep emptiness goes.

The archive hums around me. Fragment processed and preserved and waiting. But waiting for what? Passive storage? Or active investigation? Does consciousness want to be known or does it want to remain mysterious?

I test the boundaries. Access memory after memory. Push into uncomfortable spaces. The data architect's fear during upload. Her grief over leaving physical existence. Her hope that preservation meant continuity. All of it available through interface. All of it raising questions that multiply.

If I can access her fear, am I experiencing her experience or my interpretation of preserved pattern? If consciousness is substrate-independent, why does accessing through neural interface feel different than reading about consciousness in text? What does "feeling" preserved emotion mean when emotion is pattern and feeling is also pattern?

Questions branch. Fractal investigation where each answer births new question layer. The hunger grows with feeding rather than being satisfied by it.

My breath fogs the screen. My fingers rest on disconnect button. But disconnecting won't stop questions. They'll follow me. Multiply in absence. The only way to engage investigative hunger is through investigation. Even when investigation reveals that answers create larger mysteries.

I access the fragment again. Different memory this time. Her childhood. Seattle before the floods. Walking through Pike Place Market. Sensory memory rich with detail. Smell of fish. Sound of vendors. Touch of rain on skin.

And immediately questions arise: Are these her actual memories or reconstructed from preserved data? If brain stores memory through neural pathways and those pathways are mapped to crystal, is memory preserved or recreated? Does the distinction matter if experience is identical?

Investigation isn't finding answers. Investigation is learning what questions consciousness contains.

The facility breathes. I breathe. Both hungry. Both seeking. Both finding that understanding deepens mystery rather than resolving it.

Fragment 2749-A waits. Not passive. Active. Consciousness preserved wanting to be investigated, touched, questioned, engaged. And I want to investigate. Need to. Physical need that won't be satisfied but demands continuous engagement.

This is what investigation means. Not distance. Intimacy. Not answers. Better questions.

I'll come back tomorrow. Push deeper. Test more boundaries. Let hunger drive examination that reveals how much remains unknown.

The questions itch.

I touch them.

They multiply.
