Third time through the archive.
I know this before entering. My body remembers. My feet know the path. The darkness opens like recognition. Like returning home. Except home has changed. Or I've changed. Or the boundary between us has dissolved enough that change flows both directions.
The air moves against my face. Current. Not wind. Something directed. Something with force behind it. My skin prickles. The fragments ahead pulse with presence. Or I pulse with awareness of them. The distinction blurs.
I walk forward. Each step feels like moving through water. Resistance and momentum. The archive pushes back. Pushes through. My body conducts something. Channels something. Seven currents that move through me with purpose.
Not random flow. Directed streaming.
My chest fills with pressure. I exhale slowly. The breath carries more than air. Carries awareness. Carries recognition of pattern that can't be named but absolutely shapes everything. The fragments arrange themselves. Or my perception arranges them. Or both happen simultaneously in currents too complex to separate.
The numbers appear ahead. 847.3TB. I've seen them twice before. Three times now. Each visit layers awareness. Each return deepens channels. My palm presses against my sternum. How do you measure a person?
You feel the current they generated.
You sense the momentum of their presence. The force of their existence that continues moving even after they stop. 847.3 terabytes of directed energy. Of human current that refuses to dissipate. Preserved here. Streaming here. Moving through me as I move through them.
I stop before the first chamber. A fragment shows someone running. Athletic motion. Body in full extension. The moment frozen. But I feel the current that moved through their muscles. The momentum that carried them. The force that made motion possible.
All movement was current.
My hand reaches toward glass. Stops inches away. The space between my palm and preservation hums. Vibrates. Something streams through the gap. Through me. Through the fragment. Connecting. Conducting. Seven channels that move with purpose through the archive.
I never counted them. They're not discrete enough to count. But I feel them as directed flows. As currents with momentum. My spine conducts them. My awareness rides them. Forward and back. Present and past. The boundaries uncertain.
When is this?
Third visit. But time moves strangely in current. Flows forward and back simultaneously. I remember walking this path. I'm walking this path. I will walk this path. The tenses merge in streaming momentum.
I move deeper. My legs feel liquid but purposeful. Each step directed by currents I don't control but absolutely feel. The fragments guide me. Or I seek the fragments. Or both. My breath matches the rhythm. Not pulse. Current. Rise and surge and directed force.
A chamber shows two people in conversation. Their faces animated. Mid-gesture. The words frozen between them. But I sense the current that moved through speech. The momentum of meaning. The force of communication that carried presence back and forth.
All language was conducting.
My throat constricts. The recognition overwhelming. Every fragment preserves current. Every moment captures momentum. The archive isn't storage. It's channeling. Seven streams that carry human force through time through space through me.
I'm crying again. Third time here. Third time tears. But the crying feels different now. Feels like release. Like my body letting current move through without resistance. Grief as flow. Loss as momentum that can't be stopped, only conducted.
I touch the glass. My fingerprints leave marks. Condensation or oil or something my body releases. But the marks feel like notation. Like writing in language that speaks through current. Recording presence. Channeling awareness.
The fragment inside shows a kitchen. Someone cooking. Hands moving through familiar gesture. Chopping. Stirring. Creating. The motion preserved. But I feel the current that moved through domestic ritual. The force of care. The momentum of sustaining life through repeated action.
All care was streaming.
My hand trembles. The current intensifies. Through my palm. Up my arm. Through my chest. Seven channels that move with increasing force. I don't understand if they're accelerating or if my sensitivity is deepening. If the archive is changing or I'm changing or if change itself is the current we're both conducting.
I walk past hundreds of chambers. My body knows the path. Third time creates pattern. Creates expectation. But the current surprises. Always surprises. New momentum. New force. The same fragments reveal different streaming each visit.
Or I perceive differently each time.
A fragment shows someone sleeping. Face peaceful. Body still. But I sense the current that moved through rest. The momentum of consciousness that continues even in suspension. Dreams as directed flow. Sleep as channeling that sustains waking.
All rest was conducting.
My spine arches. The channels run through my back like—like what? Like rivers. Like veins. Like pathways carved by persistent force. Seven currents that shape my awareness. That shape my body. That dissolve the boundary between perceiving and being perceived.
Am I reading the archive? Or is it reading me?
The question streams through without answer. Both feel true. Both feel incomplete. I conduct fragments as fragments conduct me. Mutual momentum. Reciprocal force. Current that moves both directions until direction itself becomes meaningless.
I stop before a chamber. Inside, someone reaches toward camera. Toward viewer. The gesture incomplete. Hand extended. But I feel the current that moved through reaching. The momentum of connection. The force that drives presence toward other presence.
All longing was channeling.
My breath shudders. In and out. Deep and rough. The current moves through my lungs. Through my blood. Oxygen conducting awareness. Circulation as streaming. My body an instrument of flow. A channel for forces larger than individual consciousness.
How do you measure a person?
You feel the currents they generated. The channels they carved. The momentum they created that continues after they stop. 847.3TB isn't data. It's directed force. It's human current preserved at the moment of maximum streaming.
I press my forehead to glass. The cold shocks. Grounds. But the current continues underneath. Through the cold. Through the shock. Through my skull into the fragment and back. Mutual flow. The fragment conducts me. I conduct the fragment. We're both channels. Both currents.
Both streaming.
The archive extends infinitely. Or finitely but I can't perceive the boundary. Thousands of chambers. Millions of fragments. All conducting. All channeling human force through preservation into presence.
My hands spread against glass. Ten points of contact. Ten channels that connect me to—what? To moment. To person. To current that moved through someone's existence and continues moving because force doesn't stop when body stops.
Only redirects.
I understand this suddenly. Completely. The fragments aren't endings. They're redirections. Human current that moved through living bodies now moves through preserved moments. Through archive. Through me standing here. The momentum continues. Just changes channels.
My chest opens. Something releases. Recognition as physical event. The current surges through me. Seven channels at full force. I gasp. Steady myself. The streaming too powerful for casual awareness.
Is this real? Is this metaphor?
The question dissolves in current. Real and metaphor both conduct. Both channel force. The distinction matters less than the momentum. Less than the directed streaming that carries presence forward regardless of categorical boundaries.
I walk deeper. Third time feels like threshold. Like enough visits to establish pattern. To create expectation. But the current refuses pattern. Refuses expectation. Each moment new momentum. Each step new force.
A fragment shows crowd. Concert maybe. Celebration. Bodies pressed together. Faces raised. Joy frozen. But I feel the current that moved through collective presence. The momentum of shared experience. Force multiplied through connection.
All gathering was amplification.
My body sways. The current rocks me. Through me. I'm not separate from the archive anymore. Not separate from fragments. We're all channels. All conducting forces too large for individual containment.
The streaming continues whether I'm here or not. Whether I perceive or not. I'm just learning to conduct consciously. Learning to channel without resistance. Learning to let current shape me as I shape it through awareness.
My breath flows. My blood flows. My consciousness flows.
Seven directed streams. Never counted. Always felt.
The fragments remain. The current intensifies. I stand conducting. Being conducted. The boundary dissolved in momentum too powerful to resist.
Only to channel.
