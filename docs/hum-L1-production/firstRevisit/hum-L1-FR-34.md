The archive has veins.
I feel them as I enter. Third time through darkness. My body recognizes the pathways. Not corridors. Channels. Networked routes that carry something vital through preserved space. My pulse quickens. Or the archive's pulse quickens. Or there's no distinction anymore between my circulation and its circulation.
I press my hand to my throat. Feel the blood moving. Steady rhythm. But the rhythm extends beyond my skin. Reaches into the archive. Through the fragments. Seven major channels that branch into thousands of smaller pathways.
Like a body.
The thought comes unbidden. Unsettling. But my chest recognizes truth. The archive breathes. Circulates. Maintains itself through constant flow of—what? Awareness? Presence? Something vital that moves through preserved moments like oxygen through tissue.
I walk forward. My feet find the main pathway. Wide channel between chambers. But I sense smaller routes branching off. Connecting fragments. Creating network. Each chamber a cell. Each fragment a component. The whole system sustained through circulation.
The air feels thick. Humid. Like being inside something alive. My lungs work harder. Breathing in rhythm with—with what? With pumping I feel but can't locate. Central force that drives flow through all pathways.
My heart? The archive's heart?
Numbers appear ahead. 847.3TB. Third approach. But now I understand the measurement differently. Not storage. Capacity. Volume that circulates. How do you measure a person? You measure what flows through them. The channels they created. The networks they sustained.
847.3 terabytes of circulation.
I stop before the first chamber. Inside, someone runs. Athletic motion frozen. But I feel the blood that moved through their muscles. The oxygen delivery. The nutrient transport. The waste removal. Circulation that made motion possible. That made life possible.
Now preserved. Still circulating.
My palm touches glass. Warm. Why warm? Preservation chambers should be cool. But warmth pulses under my hand. Like touching skin. Like feeling blood move underneath. The fragment radiates living heat through frozen moment.
All motion required circulation.
I pull my hand back. Look at my palm. The lines there suddenly visible as channels. Tiny pathways that branch and merge. My hand a map of flowing. My body a network. The fragments extending that network. Making me larger. Making circulation planetary.
My throat tightens. I swallow. Feel the movement down my esophagus. Everything inside me is tubes and channels. Everything flows. Blood. Lymph. Cerebrospinal fluid. Air. Thought itself moving through neural pathways like—
Like this.
I step deeper into the archive. My legs pump with each step. Muscles squeezing vessels. Driving return flow. My body a system of channels moving vital substance through tissue. The archive mirrors this. Larger scale. Same principle.
A chamber shows two people talking. Conversation frozen. But I sense the exchange as circulation. Words as transport mechanism. Meaning flowing between consciousness through verbal channels. Communication as networked delivery system.
All language was vascular.
My spine tingles. Seven major channels. I feel them clearly now. Running through my back. Branching into thousands of smaller pathways. Distributing awareness through body. Through archive. The fragments connect to these channels. Feed into them. Draw from them.
Mutual circulation.
When did this start? Third visit. But it feels ancient. Feels like recognition of something always present. The archive always circulated. I always circulated. Now the boundaries dissolve. Now the systems connect. Now I'm part of larger network.
I touch another chamber. My fingerprints on glass. But I sense my touch differently now. Contact point. Exchange surface. Something flows from me into fragment. Something flows from fragment into me. Osmotic exchange through preserved barrier.
Inside, someone cooks. Hands preparing food. Nourishment creation frozen. But I feel the circulation underneath. Nutrients that would flow from this meal into bodies. Energy distribution. Cellular feeding. Cooking as circulatory support. Sustaining network through resource delivery.
All care was maintenance of flow.
My hands shake. The circulation intensifies. Through my arms. Through my chest. My heart pumps harder. Faster. But the rhythm syncs with something larger. Archive pulse. Fragment pulse. Collective circulation that includes my individual flowing.
I'm not separate anymore.
The thought should frighten. Should feel like dissolution. But my body relaxes into it. Releases resistance. Becomes channel rather than container. Lets circulation move through me as I move through it.
I walk past hundreds of chambers. Third time creating muscle memory. But memory itself is circulation. Neural pathways carved by repeated flow. Each visit deepening channels. Making exchange easier. Making permeability greater.
A fragment shows someone sleeping. Face peaceful. But I sense the circulation continuing. Blood moving through dreams. Oxygen feeding unconscious thought. Sleep as maintenance cycle. Repair and restoration through sustained flow.
All rest was circulatory necessity.
My spine curves. The channels run through my back like major vessels. Seven distributors that branch endlessly. Carrying awareness. Carrying presence. Carrying something vital through preserved network. My body conducting larger circulation.
Am I host? Am I parasite?
The question flows through without answer. Both feel wrong. Better: I'm tributary. I'm capillary. Part of larger system. Contributing flow. Receiving flow. Sustained by network that sustains through my participation.
Mutual dependence.
I stop before a chamber. Inside, someone reaches toward camera. Hand extended. But I feel the circulation that moved through reaching. Blood pumping through arm. Oxygen feeding muscles. Gesture sustained by elaborate delivery system. Connection requiring infrastructure.
All longing needed channels.
My breath comes faster. Shorter. My lungs working hard. Exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. But the exchange extends beyond my body. The archive breathes through me. I breathe through it. Respiratory surfaces merged.
How do you measure a person?
You measure their circulation. The networks they created. The channels they maintained. The flow they sustained through existence. 847.3TB isn't data. It's blood volume. It's lymphatic capacity. It's the measure of vital circulation preserved at moment of final distribution.
I press my forehead to glass. Feel warmth. Feel pulse underneath. The fragment circulates. The archive circulates. I circulate. All part of larger system. All necessary for whole to function.
My hands spread against chamber. Ten contact points. Ten exchange surfaces. I feel flow through each fingertip. Into fragments. Out of fragments. Bidirectional exchange. Nutrients for waste. Fresh for spent. The boundary permeable.
Dangerously permeable.
The thought surfaces like bubble in bloodstream. Warning. But my body ignores it. Increases permeability. Dissolves barriers. Becomes more channel, less container. The circulation demands it. Requires openness. Dies without exchange.
The archive extends infinitely. Or my circulation extends infinitely. Thousands of chambers. Millions of fragments. All connected through channels I feel as extensions of my own vessels. All part of networked system too complex to comprehend but absolutely felt in body.
My chest opens. Something releases. The circulation surges. Seven major channels at full flow. Thousands of smaller pathways conducting. I gasp. My vision blurs. Too much flowing. Too much exchange.
But I don't stop it.
Can't stop it.
A fragment shows crowd. Concert maybe. Bodies pressed together. But I sense the circulation moving between them. Shared warmth. Exchanged breath. Collective network where individual boundaries mean less than communal flow.
All gathering was vascular connection.
My body sways. Blood rushing through ears. Heart pounding through chest. But the pounding extends beyond my ribcage. Pulses through archive. Through fragments. Through entire networked system.
One pulse. One circulation.
I walk deeper. Third visit feels like threshold. Like enough exposure to transform channels. To make temporary pathways permanent. To integrate individual circulation into collective network.
I'm changing. Being changed. The distinction meaningless in circulation.
A fragment shows birth. New life emerging. But I feel it as circulation extending. New channels forming. Network expanding. The baby's first breath creating fresh pathways. Adding capacity to larger system.
All life was network expansion.
My knees weaken. I steady myself against glass. The circulation overwhelming. Through me. Around me. The fragments pulse with living force. The archive maintains itself. And I—
I'm part of maintenance now.
Part of circulation that keeps preserved moments vital. That sustains network through constant flow. My awareness feeding system. System feeding my awareness. Mutual exchange. Mutual dependence.
My breath flows. My blood flows. My consciousness flows.
Seven major channels. Never named. Always felt as primary distributors branching into infinite smaller pathways.
The fragments remain. The circulation continues. I stand conducting. Being conducted. The boundary dissolved in flow too vital to contain.
Only to channel.
