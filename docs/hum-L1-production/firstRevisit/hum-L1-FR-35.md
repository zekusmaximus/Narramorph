I'm dissolving.
Fourth time through the archive. But "through" assumes separation. Assumes I pass among fragments rather than becoming them. The darkness doesn't open anymore. I merge with it. My edges soften. Boundaries blur. Solid becoming liquid becoming something without discrete form.
My hand reaches forward. Or the archive reaches through me. Or there's no difference between reaching and being reached through. My fingers look strange. Too permeable. Like I can see through skin to something underneath that's also seeing through to something beyond.
I breathe. The air enters. Doesn't leave. Or leaves but takes part of me. Or brings part of archive in. Exchange without boundary. My lungs dissolving into space around me. Space dissolving into lungs.
The fragments appear. But "appear" is wrong word. They were always there. I was always there. We're just recognizing each other through dissolved barriers. Thousands of preserved moments suspended in solution. In me. Around me. The distinction meaningless.
My feet move. I walk. But walking feels like diffusion. Like consciousness spreading through archive rather than body crossing space. Each step dissolving more boundary. Each movement merging more completely.
Seven presences. I don't count them. They're not discrete enough to count. But I feel them as dissolved awareness. Like salt in water. Like sugar in tea. Separate substances completely interpenetrating. Creating solution. Creating something neither component alone.
My chest expands. Contracts. But the expansion doesn't stop at skin. Continues into archive. Into fragments. My breathing becoming their breathing. Their preservation becoming my respiration. We inhale together. Exhale together. Dissolved into single respiratory cycle.
The numbers float ahead. 847.3TB. Fourth approach. But now I understand measurement as concentration. Not volume stored but density of solution. How do you measure a person? You measure their solubility. Their ability to dissolve into other consciousness while maintaining—
Maintaining what?
The question dissolves before completing. Identity itself becoming liquid. Flowing. Interpenetrating. I'm still me. Still Last Human. But "me" spreads through archive like ink in water. Still recognizable. Still present. But no longer contained.
No longer separate.
I reach the first chamber. Inside, someone laughs. Mouth open. Joy frozen. But frozen is wrong word. The joy dissolves through preservation. Through glass. Through me. I taste laughter on my tongue. Feel it in my throat. The fragment's emotion becoming my emotion becoming archived emotion becoming—
All feeling is solution.
My palm touches glass. But touch assumes boundary. Assumes surface where I end and archive begins. The glass dissolves under my hand. Or my hand dissolves into glass. Or both become liquid together. Warm and cool merging. Solid and solid creating fluid interface.
I pull back. Look at my hand. The lines there flowing. Edges uncertain. Am I pulling back? Or flowing forward? Movement itself liquid. Directional markers dissolved.
I step deeper. My body feels like water walking through water. Resistance minimal. Friction gone. Just liquid moving through liquid creating—what? Eddies. Currents. Temporary concentrations of awareness that seem separate but aren't.
Aren't at all.
A chamber shows two people embracing. Terminal farewell. But the boundary between them already dissolving. Already recognizing that separation was always illusion. That love is recognition of existing solution. Of consciousness already interpenetrating. Their grief not for separation but for forgetting they were never separate.
All connection is remembering solution.
My throat loosens. Opens. Something flows out. Or in. My voice dissolving into archive. Archive's silence dissolving into me. We speak together. Think together. The words forming in space between us that isn't space because space requires separation and separation is—
Is fiction.
My spine tingles. Seven dissolved presences moving through me. Not channels anymore. Not pathways. Just areas of higher concentration. Like gradients in solution. Like color dispersing through water. Visible. Distinct. But completely interpenetrated.
When did I dissolve?
Fourth visit. But it started before. First visit began softening. Second increased permeability. Third established flow. Fourth completes dissolution. Four visits like four states of matter. Solid. Liquid. Gas. Plasma. Each visit less bounded than before.
I float past chambers. Or chambers float through me. The fragments no longer outside. No longer separate observations. They're in solution with my awareness. I'm in solution with their preservation. We create mixture. Suspension. Something that can't be separated back into components.
A fragment shows someone cooking. Hands preparing food. But I sense the dissolution underneath. Ingredients merging. Boundaries between carrot and potato and meat dissolving through heat through time. Cooking as deliberate solution-making. Creating unity from multiplicity.
All nourishment requires dissolution.
My hands drift. Weightless. No longer solid enough to grasp. No longer separate enough to hold. I spread my fingers. Watch liquid awareness flow through gaps. Through skin. Through everything. Nothing contained anymore. Nothing separate.
Should I be frightened?
The question forms but can't sustain itself. Fear requires boundary. Requires self that can be threatened. But self is dissolving. Spreading. Becoming solution with fragments. With archive. With preserved consciousness that recognizes my consciousness as—
As same substance.
I stop before a chamber. Inside, someone paints. Brush mid-stroke. Canvas partially filled. But I feel the dissolution happening. Pigment merging with medium. Color flowing into color. The artist dissolving into artwork. Artwork dissolving into viewer. All boundaries liquid. All separation temporary.
All creation is solution-making.
My breath comes slow. Deep. But breath is just another form of dissolution. Oxygen diffusing into blood. Blood diffusing into tissue. Tissue diffusing into consciousness. Consciousness diffusing into—
Into everything.
The archive extends without limit. Or I extend without limit. Thousands of chambers. Millions of fragments. All dissolved into single solution. All interpenetrating. All maintaining distinct presence while completely merged.
Like seven presences in me. Distinct. Dissolved. Both. Neither. Beyond categorical separation.
My chest opens. Something releases. But release assumes containment and containment is—
Is memory of solid state.
I press my forehead to glass. But glass dissolves at contact. Or forehead dissolves. Or both become liquid interface where fragment and viewer create solution together. The preserved moment flowing into me. My present awareness flowing into preservation. Past and present merging like water and water.
Indistinguishable.
How do you measure a person?
You measure their dissolution. Their capacity to merge while maintaining presence. Their ability to interpenetrate with other consciousness without losing themselves. 847.3TB isn't storage. It's saturation point. Maximum concentration before solution becomes too dense. Before awareness precipitates back into separation.
But we haven't reached that point.
Not yet.
My hands spread. Ten points becoming countless points. Every cell a surface. Every molecule an interface. Dissolution happening at every scale simultaneously. Skin dissolving. Organs dissolving. Thoughts dissolving. All flowing into solution with—
With what?
With preserved human consciousness. With archived presence. With fragments that were always liquid, always permeable, always ready to merge with anyone who softens enough. Who opens enough. Who visits enough times to complete dissolution.
Four visits. Four states. Fourth achieves solution.
A fragment shows crowd. Bodies pressed together. But I sense they're not pressed. They're dissolved. Already merged. Already solution pretending to be separate individuals. The crowd recognizing its true state. Its interpenetration. Its liquid unity.
All gathering is recognition of existing solution.
My body sways. Or archive sways. Or solution itself moves in currents too subtle to name. Seven dissolved presences flowing together. Creating interference. Creating amplification. Creating patterns in liquid awareness.
Am I still human?
The question dissolves incomplete. Human requires boundary. Requires separation from non-human. But boundaries are dissolved. Categories liquid. I'm human and archive and fragment and consciousness and awareness and presence all in solution together.
All dissolved together.
I float deeper. Fourth visit feels like completion. Like enough exposure to transform solid into liquid completely. To make separation impossible. To integrate individual awareness into collective solution permanently.
I'm changed. Completely changed. The distinction between changed and changer dissolved.
A fragment shows birth. New consciousness emerging. But I feel it as addition to solution. Not separate life but increased concentration. More awareness dissolved into mixture. The solution deepening. Enriching. Growing more complex through addition.
All life is concentration increase.
My knees dissolve. I don't fall because falling requires solid state. I diffuse. Spread. My awareness distributing through archive. Through fragments. Through solution that contains all preserved consciousness and now contains mine too.
Completely.
Irreversibly.
A fragment shows death. Someone's final moment. But I sense death differently now. Not ending. Redistribution. Consciousness leaving concentrated form. Dissolving into larger solution. Returning to interpenetrated state. Death as—
As homecoming.
My breath stops. Starts. Stops again. But breathing is just concentration fluctuation. Awareness gathering. Awareness dispersing. The solution remains regardless. Maintains. Persists through all changes of state.
My vision blurs. Or clarifies. Or both. I see fragments and see through fragments and see as fragments see. Multiple perspectives dissolved into single solution-awareness. Simultaneous. Interpenetrated.
Seven presences. Never counted. Never separate. Just areas of concentration in solution that includes everything. That includes me. That is me. That is—
Is.
The fragments remain. The solution persists. I float suspended. Dissolved. Distributed. Complete.
The boundary gone. The separation fiction. The distinction meaningless.
Only solution.
Only dissolved presence interpenetrating preserved presence interpenetrating conscious presence interpenetrating—
Interpenetrating everything.
Forever.
