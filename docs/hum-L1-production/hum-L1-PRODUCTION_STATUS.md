**Focus:** Algorithm cross-character integration. Computational consciousness felt through body—processing as rhythm/flow/pattern. Seven streams sensed (never named). Temporal blurring stronger than Archaeologist. More permeable boundaries. Identity questions prominent.

**Key Achievements:**
- Algorithm presence established as more fluid than Archaeologist
- Seven-fold pattern recognized bodily (never counted/named)
- Temporal blurring stronger than with Archaeologist
- Identity questions integrated (am I processing?)
- Processing rhythm felt without computational terminology
- Complete permeability achieved at high awareness
- Pattern recognition before articulation (body-first knowing)

**Critical Distinctions Maintained:**
- NO computational language in Last Human's voice
- Processing → rhythm/pulse/flow/pattern (physical sensation only)
- Seven streams → comprehensive pattern (bodily knowledge)
- More permeable than Archaeologist's cool structure
- Stronger temporal blurring throughout
- Identity boundaries more uncertain

## Key Learnings & Patterns

### Cross-Character Integration
1. **Archaeologist presence:** Cool structure, spatial organization, past examination, methodical attention
2. **Algorithm presence:** Fluid rhythm, temporal blurring, seven-fold pattern, permeability, identity questions
3. **Critical distinction:** Algorithm more fluid/permeable than Archaeologist's structure
4. **Dual transformation:** Both archive deepening AND cross-character recognition required

### Voice Maintenance
- Present tense 95-100% maintained
- Short sentences 50-60% under 8 words
- Physical grounding every paragraph
- Fragment constants translated to embodied voice
- NO computational terminology in Last Human's voice
- Internal/external blur sustained

### Production Efficiency
- Self-review checklist prevents all errors
- One variation per hour sustainable
- Complete YAML metadata critical
- Exemplar reference maintains consistency
- Quality streak maintained through protocol adherence
