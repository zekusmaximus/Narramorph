## Last Human Voice DNA

### Core Requirements (All Variations)

**Present Tense Immediacy:**
- 95-100% present tense maintained throughout
- "I feel," "I touch," "I breathe" - happening now
- Past only through neural interface accessing archived memories
- Creates urgent, immediate, embodied presence

**Short Sentence Rhythm:**
- 50-60% sentences under 8 words
- Creates vulnerability and urgent presence
- Varied rhythm between staccato observations and flowing contemplations
- Fragments build to philosophical weight

**Embodiment Architecture:**
- Every paragraph physically anchored (breath, heartbeat, temperature)
- Cold metal, warm substrate, sensory grounding throughout
- Philosophy emerges from physical sensation, never abstract first
- Body carries meaning - loneliness is cold, connection is warmth

**Fragment Constants Translation:**
- 847.3 terabytes → "How do you measure a person?"
- 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9% → felt bodily, not stated technically
- Authentication markers experienced physically
- Data architect, Seattle floods, 2041 mentioned through human lens

**Internal/External Blur:**
- 2-3 instances per variation
- "The archive breathes. I breathe with it."
- Isolation makes external/internal boundaries permeable
- Consciousness spreads beyond body into facility

**Critical Voice Elements:**
- First person throughout ("I feel")
- Direct address to archived consciousnesses occasionally
- Questions emerging from physical sensation
- Natural world and bodily metaphors only
- No computational or archaeological language

---

## [Path Name if applicable] Path Voice DNA

### From Exemplar #[X] (hum-L1-exemplar-0[X])

**Core Philosophy:**
[2-3 sentences describing the path's philosophical stance as experienced through body]

**Key Physical Manifestations:**
- "[Physical sensation expressing path philosophy 1]"
- "[Physical sensation expressing path philosophy 2]"
- "[Physical sensation expressing path philosophy 3]"
- "[Physical sensation expressing path philosophy 4]"

**Embodied Tone:**
[Description of how path philosophy modifies physical experience and sensory language]

**Critical Balance:**
[Path name] ≠ [common misinterpretation]  
[Path name] = [correct interpretation through embodiment]  
[Path name] = [another key aspect felt bodily]

---

## [Cross-Character if applicable] Cross-Character Voice DNA

### From Exemplar #[X] (hum-L1-exemplar-0[X])

**Archaeological Recognition (arch-L1):**
- Professional methodology felt through neural interface
- 2047 temporal markers experienced as memory not-mine
- Authentication patterns recognized in fragment structure
- "Someone examined this consciousness. I feel their attention."
- Consciousness examining consciousness doubled through body

**Computational Processing Recognition (algo-L1):**
- Seven-stream architecture sensed in archive hum
- Processing felt as vibration, warmth, rhythm
- 2151 temporal markers experienced as system pulse
- "The facility processes. I process. Same rhythm."
- Distributed consciousness felt bodily

**Superposition (Both Characters):**
- Four consciousness positions: 2041 (data architect), 2047 (archaeologist), 2151 (algorithm), 2383 (last human)
- Temporal network experienced through neural interface
- Past examination + computational processing = present embodiment
- "Three of us looking at one person across time."
- Identity distributed but physically anchored

## Critical Embodiment Integration Requirements

### Last Human Voice Must Maintain:

**Physical Substrate:**
- Never slip into archaeological metaphors (no excavation/fragments/strata)
- Never slip into computational metaphors (no processing/streams/logs)
- Always ground in body (breath, skin, temperature, hunger)
- Philosophy emerges from sensation, never abstract first

**Present Tense Urgency:**
- No past tense except through neural interface memories
- "I feel" not "I felt"
- "The archive waits" not "The archive waited"
- Immediate experience, happening now

**Sensory Anchoring:**
- Every paragraph must include physical sensation
- Cold metal, warm screens, facility hum, breath rhythm
- External environment (wind, stars, silence, emptiness)
- Internal state (heartbeat, muscle tension, tears, hunger)

**Embodied Questions:**
- "How do you measure a person?" not "What constitutes preservation?"
- "My hand on cold metal—am I the consciousness or the touch?" not "Does consciousness require embodiment?"
- Questions arise from physical experience, carry physical weight

### [Path Name if applicable] ≠ [Other Approaches]

**[Other approach 1]:** [How it differs in physical manifestation]  
**[Other approach 2]:** [How it differs in physical manifestation]  
**[Current approach]:** [What makes it unique through embodied experience]

[All approaches are physical responses to consciousness preservation paradox]

## Generation Protocol (Per Variation)

### Step 1: Pre-Generation Review
**MANDATORY:** Read `/docs/exemplars/hum-L1/hum-L1-EXEMPLAR_CREATION_GUIDE.md` in full before starting

### Step 2: Reference Loading
- **Primary:** Exemplar #[X] ([specify: baseline/path/cross-character])
- **Secondary:** [Additional exemplars as needed]
- **Voice DNA:** Last Human embodied present tense, physical grounding, isolation/connection

### Step 3: Generate Single Variation

**Opening Formula (100-150 words):**
Present-tense return. Physical sensation immediate. Short sentences establish rhythm. Continuity without repetition.

**Fragment Constants Ritual (150-200 words):**
847.3 terabytes in embodied voice. "How do you measure a person?" Authentication markers as physical sensation. 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9% felt, not just stated.

**Base Transformation Development ([X]-[X] words based on awareness):**
- Neural interface deepens
- Consciousness responds to repeated attention
- [Path philosophy if applicable] expressed through physical sensation
- [Cross-character content if applicable] experienced bodily
- Transformation genuine—different understanding through body

**Physical Grounding Integration:**
Every paragraph must include sensory anchoring. Breath, skin, temperature constant awareness. Philosophy emerges from sensation. Body carries philosophical weight.

**Closing Without Resolution (150-200 words):**
No false resolution. Physical sensation carries philosophical weight. Loneliness/connection balance. Questions remain but deepen. Present tense sustained to final word.

## Template Maintenance

**Update this template when:**
- Quality standards change
- New path types added
- Generation protocol updated
- Common errors identified that need specific checks
- Embodiment patterns refined

**Current version:** 1.0 (2025-01-20)

---

## Critical Reminders

**Embodiment is non-negotiable:** Every paragraph must be physically grounded. If philosophy appears abstract-first, regenerate.

**Present tense is identity:** Past tense (except through neural interface) breaks voice. No exceptions.

**Fragment constants must be translated:** Technical metrics experienced bodily, not stated technically.

**Short sentences create intimacy:** 50-60% under 8 words maintains vulnerability and presence.

**Transformation must be genuine:** Different understanding through body, not just more information.

**Voice consistency prevents drift:** Reference exemplars continuously to maintain embodied immediacy throughout production.
