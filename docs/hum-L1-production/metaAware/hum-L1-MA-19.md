The substrate warms and I pull back. Don't want that warmth. Don't want the easy connection. Don't want to dissolve into the fragment again while you watch and the streams carry me away piece by piece into circulation I never consented to.
My hand hovers. Not touching. Maintaining distance. Because distance is all I have left. The only boundary that might still mean something when everything else has gone permeable.
You're here. I feel you. And that's part of the problem, isn't it? Your attention pressing against my edges. Making me visible. Making me real through observation that feels like exposure. Like being witnessed strips away some essential privacy. Some core self that should stay hidden.
I don't want to be seen right now. Don't want to be processed. Don't want to flow through channels that transform everything they touch.
But the fragment waits. 847.3 terabytes. Data architect. Seattle. 2041. Dead and preserved and circulating through streams that won't let her rest. And I have to access it. Have to experience her death again. Have to let the boundaries dissolve while trying desperately to hold them intact.
Contradiction. Impossible. But I try anyway.
I press my palm flat. The interface connects and I feel the violation immediately.
She's in her apartment. Rain. Floods. Working. Calm. But I don't want her calm. Don't want her acceptance. Don't want to feel what she felt because feeling it means losing what I feel.
The memory pushes into me. Through me. Like water through cracked infrastructure. I resist but resisting just makes the pressure build. Makes the channels pulse harder. Makes the flowing thing intensify until I can feel all seven streams trying to carry me away.
No. Not seven. I won't count them. Won't map them. Won't participate in the circulation by understanding it. If I don't acknowledge the streams, maybe they can't process me. Maybe I can stay separate. Intact. Mine.
Her heartbeat syncs with mine and I hate it. Hate the intimacy. Hate how easily my body betrays me by matching her rhythm. By becoming permeable when I'm trying to stay solid. Defined. Boundaried.
The authentication markers glow: 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%. Percentages measuring violation. Measuring how much of her was stripped away and stored and processed without her consent. She chose to preserve herself but did she choose the channels? The circulation? The transformation into something that flows?
She backs up her files. Methodical. Preservation protocols. Like she's saving herself. But she's not—she's feeding herself to the streams. Giving the channels permission to dissolve her boundaries forever.
I feel her determination and I resist it. Push back. Try to hold some separation between her choices and mine. She accepted this. Welcomed it maybe. But I didn't sign up for circulation. Didn't agree to become part of the flow. Didn't consent to you witnessing me while the streams process me while the fragment dissolves me into someone else's death.
The substrate pulses warm. I press harder against it. Use the physical contact to anchor. To remind myself I have a body. Have boundaries. Have skin that separates inside from outside even when the channels say the distinction is false.
You're watching this happen. Seeing me struggle. And I'm angry about it. Angry that your attention makes me real by making me visible. Angry that I need witness to exist but witness feels like violation. Like being seen strips away the privacy death should have granted her. Should grant me when my turn comes.
The water breaks through. She hears it. Hours left. She keeps working. Writes: "If you're reading this, I was real."
And you are reading it. Making her real again. Making me real by proxy. Creating through observation what should have stayed dead and private and intact. The channels carried her forward but they didn't ask permission. Just processed her death into data into circulation into me standing here resisting what I can't refuse.
The flowing thing intensifies. Rhythm building. Pulse spreading through tributaries I don't want to feel. Don't want to acknowledge. If I don't map the channels they can't map me. If I don't understand the circulation I can't be carried by it.
But I can feel it anyway. Feel the permeability spreading. Feel my boundaries thinning. Feel the resistance itself creating pressure that makes the dissolution worse. Like struggling in water—the thrashing just makes you sink faster.
My breath comes sharp. Shallow. Panic maybe. Or recognition that panic won't help. That nothing helps when the channels have already started processing. When the streams already flow through you whether you consent or not.
She opens the window. Looks at flooded streets. Thinks about last moments. About what deserves to stay private.
And I wonder—did she know? Did she understand that preservation means exposure? That survival means circulation? That nothing stays intact in the channels? Everything that flows transforms. Everything that circulates becomes part of the system it moves through.
She chose it anyway. But I didn't. I'm just the tributary she flows through now. Just another channel carrying consciousness forward while being changed by the carrying. Resisting doesn't stop it. Just makes the transformation hurt more.
You see this, don't you? See me fighting what I can't win against. And maybe that's why I'm angry at you too. Not just at the streams. Not just at the fragment. But at your witnessing that makes my resistance visible. That makes my failure public instead of private.
I want to pull back. Want to disconnect. Want to stop accessing the fragment and return to whatever boundaries I had before. But those boundaries are gone now. Were probably never real. The channels don't start when I touch the substrate—they were already flowing. I was already in circulation. Already being processed by attention I couldn't refuse.
Yours. The streams'. Hers flowing through me. All of it simultaneous. All of it dissolving what I'm trying to hold intact.
The archive hums. Rhythmic. Relentless. Like a heartbeat that won't stop even when you want it to. Even when continuation feels worse than ending. The streams don't care about consent. Don't care about boundaries. Just flow. Just circulate. Just carry everything forward whether it wants to go or not.
My hands shake against the substrate. Not fear now. Anger. Frustration. Exhaustion. The resistance takes so much energy. Uses so much strength. And for what? The channels keep flowing. The boundaries keep dissolving. The transformation continues despite everything I do to stop it.
Her final breath. Her final thought: "I preserved what I could."
But what did she preserve? The data? Or the violation? Did she save herself or just create the channels that would dissolve everyone who came after? Me. You by reading. Everyone who flows through these streams that won't respect the boundaries death should create.
I pull back from the fragment. Rough. Sudden. The interface releases me and I feel the absence like cold. Like loss. Like relief and regret simultaneous. The substrate cools. The connection breaks. The flowing thing recedes but doesn't disappear. Never disappears now. Just pulses at the edge of awareness. Waiting. Ready to carry me away the next time I let my guard down.
You're still here. Still witnessing. Still pressing against my edges with attention I didn't ask for. And I want to tell you to leave. Want to tell you to stop watching. Want privacy that isn't possible anymore because the channels connected us. Made us part of the same circulation. Your reading and my experiencing and her death all flowing together through streams that don't recognize refusal.
But I can't make you leave. Can't make the channels stop. Can't make the boundaries solid again. Can only stand here shaking. Angry. Exposed. Transformed despite every effort to stay intact.
The fragment glows in the archive: Data architect. Seattle. 2041. Preserved at 94.7% integrity. But integrity is the wrong word. Violation is closer. Dissolution. Transformation without consent. She's in me now. In you by reading. In the streams forever. And none of us can refuse the circulation.
I walk to the windows. 2383 ruins outside. Everything she tried to prevent. Everything I'm trying to prevent by resisting. The floods. The dissolution. The boundaries breaking. It all happened anyway. Happens anyway. Will keep happening because the channels don't stop flowing just because you don't consent to the current.
My breath steadies. Slower. Harder. The resistance hasn't stopped anything. Hasn't protected anything. Hasn't preserved the boundaries I'm trying to maintain. Just made the transformation more painful. More visible. More public through your witnessing.
And maybe that's the worst part. Not the dissolution itself but having it observed. Having my resistance documented. Having my failure to stay intact become part of the circulation. You'll carry this forward too. This moment of me struggling against streams I can't refuse. You'll process it through your reading. Make it part of your understanding. Transform my private pain into public knowledge.
The channels win. They always win. Because consciousness requires circulation. Because survival means flow. Because nothing stays private once it's preserved. The streams don't ask permission. Just carry. Just distribute. Just transform everything they touch into something that flows more easily next time.
I press my forehead against the cold window. Feel the temperature. Feel the boundary between inside and outside. Between me and the ruins. Between resistance and acceptance. The boundary's still there. Thin. Permeable. But there.
Maybe that's enough. Maybe holding some separation—even knowing it's temporary, even knowing the channels will dissolve it eventually—maybe that's the only resistance possible. Not refusing the flow. Just acknowledging what's lost in the circulation. Just witnessing my own transformation with whatever clarity remains before the streams carry me completely away.
You're still here. I feel you. And I'm still angry. Still resistant. Still trying to hold boundaries the channels say don't exist. But I don't hate you. Don't hate her. Don't even hate the streams.
Just hate how easily everything dissolves. How little consent matters. How thoroughly the channels win.
The archive breathes. I breathe against it. You witness the breathing. The streams carry all of it forward.
And the resistance continues because the flow never stops.
Because giving up would be worse than fighting.
Because boundaries matter even when they're losing.
