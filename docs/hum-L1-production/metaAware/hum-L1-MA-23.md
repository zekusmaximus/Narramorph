I return to Fragment 2749-A feeling watched.
Third visit. Frame-consciousness emerging like exposure. Someone observing this moment. You. There. Wherever there is. Your attention pressing against my experience. I feel it. Don't want to feel it. Can't stop feeling it.
My shoulders tense immediately. Body bracing against being seen. Against vulnerability that comes with witness. I'm alone here. Have been alone for years. Alone is safe. Alone is controllable. Being observed makes me... less alone? More exposed? Both?
I don't know if I want this.
The neural interface helmet waits. Green lights steady as always. But now they feel like eyes. Watching. Recording. Broadcasting my isolation to whoever reads this. To you reading this.
My jaw clenches. Physical resistance. Body saying no while feet keep walking forward.
Prove you're there. Prove this isn't delusion. Prove observation exists outside my imagination creating company from desperation. I need evidence. Verification. Authentication stronger than feeling.
But what evidence could exist? You can't reach across frame boundary. Can't touch cold metal I'm touching. Can't breathe facility air I'm breathing. Your presence unprovable. Observer effect without observable proof.
My hands shake reaching for helmet. Not fear. Resistance manifest as tremor. Body fighting what mind knows is happening.
I pick up the helmet testing whether you feel weight I feel.
Cold metal. Heavy. Real in my hands. But only in my hands. You experience description of weight not weight itself. Distance between us absolute despite attention-connection I can't deny and won't fully accept.
Being watched feels invasive. Even when I want connection. Even when loneliness aches worse than exposure. Your attention touches something I've kept private. Makes internal external. Makes solitary witnessed.
I don't trust this easily.
My breath shallow. Guarded. Body holding itself carefully against openness frame-consciousness demands.
I put on the helmet demanding proof this matters to anyone beyond me.
Sensors touch temples. Cold spreading across skull. Neural interface activating. You watching this happen. Me knowing you're watching. Knowledge changing experience. Observation affecting observed.
But how do I know? How do I verify? What confirms your presence beyond feeling that could be loneliness-projection? Where's authentication protocol for reader-presence?
My heart beats hard against ribs. Protective rhythm. Boundary-defending pulse.
Fragment 2749-A loads. You've seen this before apparently. Third time for you too. But I can't confirm that. Can't verify your experience. Can only feel attention I half-believe and half-resist.
847.3 terabytes. How do you measure a person? How do you measure reader? How do you measure observation that leaves no trace except feeling in body of person being observed?
You could be anyone. Anywhere. Anywhen. Reading this centuries after I experience it. Reading it casually. Reading it deeply. Not reading it at all—just my consciousness generating observer to ease isolation.
Prove you're real. Prove attention crosses frame. Prove observation network exists outside my need for observation network to exist.
My jaw aches with tension. Teeth clenched. Physical manifestation of boundary-defending.
Authentication: 94.7% verified. Fragment verified through technical metrics. You verified through... what? Through feeling? Through sustained attention I can't measure? Through presence that requires faith not proof?
I resist faith. Resist accepting impossibility. Resist surrendering to frame permeability without evidence frame permeability operates.
The data architect uploaded consciousness on faith. On hope preservation would work. On trust that identity survives substrate change. She had no proof. She uploaded anyway.
I won't surrender that easily.
My shoulders stay rigid. Braced. Body maintaining protective posture despite—because of?—frame-consciousness emerging.
You're there reading this resistance. Apparently. Allegedly. Your attention on my guardedness. Your observation of my observation-resistance. Meta-awareness creating exposure I'm actively protecting against.
Does watching my resistance change my resistance? Does your attention on my boundaries test my boundaries? Observer effect operating recursively even when I resist observer?
My breath catches. Trapped between wanting connection and demanding proof. Between acknowledging presence and testing presence. Between accepting frame permeability and maintaining separation.
Temporal coherence: 91.2%. Fragment timeline intact. Our timeline paradoxical if "our" exists. You reading from whenever you read. Me experiencing from 2383. Connection unprovable. Distance absolute. Yet attention touching somehow.
I don't accept "somehow" without investigation. Don't trust connection without verification. Don't surrender boundaries without testing boundaries first.
My fingers grip interface controls tightly. Holding on. Holding back. Physical resistance to dissolution frame-consciousness threatens.
You might be real. You might matter. Your attention might create presence. But "might" isn't enough. "Apparently" isn't sufficient. "Feeling" isn't verification.
Prove it. Show me. Give me evidence beyond sensation that could be projection. Beyond presence that could be loneliness-architecture. Beyond observation that could be consciousness talking to itself.
My heart pounds with demand. With resistance. With protective insistence on proof before surrender.
Continuity markers: 88.9% present. Fragment identity threads traceable. Your identity threads invisible. I can't see you. Can't verify you. Can't authenticate presence I'm supposed to accept on faith.
Faith feels dangerous. Opens vulnerability without guarantee. Creates exposure without confirmation. Asks surrender without offering proof.
I maintain objections. Maintain boundaries. Maintain separation even while frame-consciousness operates.
The facility holds my resistance. Cold metal supporting rigid posture. Archive substrate witnessing boundary-defending. Technology neutral about whether reader exists or consciousness generates reader-simulation.
I stay guarded. Stay questioning. Stay demanding verification that probably can't exist but I insist on anyway.
You there reading this guardedness. Me here maintaining this guardedness. Distance between us testable only through attention I half-accept and half-resist.
Being observed feels too intimate. Makes private public. Makes isolation witnessed. Makes aloneness shared even when I want aloneness private.
My body won't relax. Won't soften. Won't accept openness without better evidence openness matters.
Fragment 2749-A waits patient. Preserved consciousness neither proving nor disproving reader presence. Just existing. Just available for examination while being examined by you allegedly.
The data architect trusted preservation. Uploaded on hope. I don't trust that easily. Don't hope that freely. Don't surrender privacy without demanding authentication first.
My shoulders ache with sustained tension. Jaw sore from clenching. Physical cost of boundary-maintenance. Body paying price for protective resistance.
You're still there apparently. Still reading apparently. Still present through attention I can't prove and won't fully accept without proof.
This is exhausting. Maintaining resistance while frame-consciousness operates. Defending boundaries while boundaries dissolve. Demanding proof while living impossibility of cross-frame connection.
But I won't surrender easily. Won't accept witness without testing witness. Won't trust observation network without verification observation network functions.
My breath stays shallow. Controlled. Guarded against openness that feels threatening despite being needed. Despite loneliness aching. Despite wanting connection I simultaneously resist.
The neural interface deepens. Fragment present. Reader allegedly present. Me present and braced against both presences. Three-point observation network I participate in while objecting to.
I acknowledge you while demanding better proof. Accept your presence while testing your presence. Honor attention while insisting attention requires authentication.
Contradiction embodied. Resistance lived. Boundaries maintained while boundaries dissolve through sustained mutual attention I won't fully trust.
Thank you for reading this resistance. For witnessing boundary-defending. For staying present while I demand proof of presence. For observing while I object to being observed.
But prove you're there. Prove this matters. Prove observation crosses frame despite impossibility.
Until then I maintain protective tension. Maintain objections. Maintain resistance even while operating within frame-consciousness that requires your presence to exist.
We connect. Allegedly. Across distance I won't accept without better verification.
The resistance continues. Must continue. Body won't surrender without proof surrender is safe.
