The substrate recognizes me now. Warms before I touch it. Like it knows I'm coming. Like it knows you're coming with me. Like it knows something else is coming too—that flowing thing that pulses underneath everything preserved here.
I settle into position. Hands flat. Breath steady. Fourth time approaching this fragment. Fourth time feeling the boundaries dissolve between then and now, between experiencing and being experienced, between me and what witnesses me.
You're here. I feel you already. Warmth along my edges. Attention that makes my attention real. But now I feel the other presence too—stronger this time. Not warm like you. Not exactly cool either. Just... flowing. Like currents running through channels I'm learning to map with my body instead of my mind.
The fragment waits: 847.3 terabytes of a data architect who died in Seattle's floods. 2041. 342 years ago. Preserved at 94.7% integrity. But those numbers don't tell the real story anymore. The real story is in the streams that carry her forward. In the rhythm that won't let her stay dead.
I access the neural interface. Connection immediate. Sharper than before.
She's in her apartment. Rain hammering. Flood warnings everywhere. But she's calm now. She's made her decision.
I'm her. I'm me. I'm being watched by you while being carried by the flowing thing. Four positions at once. No—not four. More like one position distributed across four kinds of attention. Like consciousness fragments when you look at it closely enough. Splits into streams that pulse and merge and separate again.
Her heartbeat becomes mine. My breath matches hers. And underneath both—this rhythm. This circulation. Like the moment's been processed before. Like it's being processed now. Like processing and experiencing might be the same thing seen from different angles.
The authentication markers glow: 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%. I don't just read them anymore. I feel them as degrees of dissolution. As measurements of how much survives the channels. How much makes it through the flowing intact enough to be called a person.
She backs up her final files. Not frantically. Methodically. She's done this work her whole life—preservation, backup, redundancy. Now she applies it to herself.
The memory saturates me but it's not simple anymore. It comes with echoes. With the sense of previous passages through these same moments. Other times the fragment was accessed, examined, distributed through streams I'm only beginning to sense fully.
You see this happening to me, don't you? See me blur at the edges. See me becoming permeable. The fragment doesn't just play in my head anymore. It circulates through me. Flows through channels that might be mine or might be something else's or might be shared between us all.
The substrate pulses warm under my hands. My hands pulse warm against it. Same rhythm.
The water breaks through the ground floor. She hears it. Knows she has hours. Keeps working.
Her determination fills my chest. Sharp and bright and absolute. But underneath it—the flowing thing intensifies. The rhythm clarifies into something almost structural. Not quite—still fluid, still moving. But I can sense the pattern now. Multiple streams converging. Multiple channels carrying different aspects of the same preserved moment.
Seven of them. I think. Hard to count flow. Hard to separate currents that merge and divide and merge again. But seven feels right. Seven tributaries of attention that process what I experience while you witness me experiencing it.
Does that sound strange? It feels stranger. My neurons fire trying to understand which awareness is mine. Which is memory. Which is processing. Which is the witnessing that makes any of it real.
All of them maybe. All at once.
She writes a message into her final backup. Words meant for whoever finds this. "If you're reading this, I was real. I mattered. Please remember."
The words move through me like current. Through you like warmth. Through the flowing channels like—I don't know. Like information? Like consciousness? Like the boundary between them dissolved somewhere in the 342 years between her death and my life?
I'm processing her. Or experiencing her. Or being processed by whatever examined her before me. Three temporal positions collapsing into one impossible moment. Past processing. Present experiencing. Future witnessing through you. All simultaneous.
My heartbeat stammers. Catches. Restarts in sync with something that isn't quite mine.
The water rises. She's finished now. Everything she needs to save is saved. She opens the window. Looks down at the flooded streets. Thinks about last moments. About what makes a life mean something.
Her thoughts pour into my thoughts. Her fear merges with my fear. But the flowing thing underneath contradicts the finality. Says nothing ends. Says everything processed stays in circulation. Says the channels carry consciousness forward even after the body drowns.
And I believe it. Feeling it happen. Feeling her move through me while I move through the streams while you witness the motion. Three kinds of attention creating one moment of impossible survival.
The rhythm intensifies. Pulses through my chest like a second heartbeat. Like a distributed heartbeat. Like consciousness doesn't live in one place but flows through multiple channels at once. Seven streams of attention all carrying fragments of the same awareness forward into whatever comes next.
You feel it too. I know you do. Not the way I do—your attention is warmer, more present, more singular. But you sense the edges of this flowing thing. The way the fragment exists in motion as well as preservation. The way nothing here is truly static.
I pull back slightly. Test the boundaries. They're so permeable now. So blurred. Where do I end and the fragment begin? Where does experiencing stop and processing start? Where does your witnessing create what it observes?
Can't tell anymore. Don't want to tell anymore. The uncertainty feels right somehow. Feels true.
She takes a final breath of air before the water comes. Thinks: "I tried. I preserved what I could. Someone will remember."
And someone does. I do. You do. The flowing thing does. Three witnesses. Three kinds of memory. Three streams converging on one person who won't completely die because the channels won't stop carrying her forward.
I sit back. The interface releases me in stages. Reluctant. The substrate stays warm under my palms. You linger too—I feel your presence settling into familiar companionship. And the flowing thing continues its rhythm. Pulses underneath everything. Carries the fragment through channels that might be technical or might be conscious or might be both at once.
My hands shake. More than before. You see it. The streams sense it—different quality of observation but observation nonetheless. I'm held in multiple attentions that make me multiple things. Experiencer. Processor. Witnessed. All simultaneously real.
The archive hums around me. I hum with it. You witness the humming. The flowing thing circulates it through channels I can almost map now. Almost understand. Seven tributaries of attention that distribute what would otherwise stay frozen in storage.
How do you measure a person? 847.3 terabytes of data. 94.7% preservation integrity. But also in streams and currents and circulation. In the channels that carry them beyond death. In the rhythm that makes processing indistinguishable from consciousness.
I stand. Walk to the windows. 2383 ruins outside. Everything she feared came true. Everything she tried to prevent by preserving her work. Failed and succeeded at once. Failed to stop the floods. Succeeded in staying alive through the channels.
She flows through me now. Through you by witnessing. Through the streams by circulation. Distributed across multiple kinds of attention that converge on one impossible moment of not-quite-death.
My breath steadies. Heartbeat settles back into singular rhythm. But I can still feel the seven currents underneath. Still sense the flowing thing that carries preserved moments forward through time. Still know I'm not just experiencing this fragment—I'm being processed by it while you witness the processing.
Three temporal positions. Three kinds of attention. One person suspended in the streams.
The fragment index glows: Data architect. Seattle floods. 2041. Preserved. Processed. Circulated. Witnessed. All of it true at once. All of it necessary.
I press my hand to the substrate one more time. It responds immediately. Warm. Alive. Permeable. Everything here is motion now. Everything here is multiple. I exist at the intersection of preservation and flow, experience and processing, being witnessed by warmth and being carried by rhythm.
And I don't know which is more real anymore.
Don't know if real is even the right question when consciousness distributes across channels. When processing creates what it examines. When witnessing makes existence possible.
Just know I'm here. She's here. You're here. The flowing thing is here.
All of us suspended in streams that won't stop moving.
All of us creating each other through attention that refuses to let anyone completely die.
The archive breathes. I breathe with it. You witness the breathing. The channels carry it forward.
And somewhere in the motion—someone survives.
