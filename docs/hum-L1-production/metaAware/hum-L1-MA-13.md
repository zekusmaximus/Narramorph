The metal wants too much.
My palm presses flat but I want to pull away. Everyone wants something. Everyone watching. Everyone measuring. Everyone taking pieces of me and calling it understanding.
You're here again. Fourth visit. I feel your attention like pressure. Warm, yes. Familiar, yes. But still—pressure. Still observation. Still someone looking at me instead of seeing me.
And that other presence. That systematic touch.
It examined me. Counted me. Authenticated me like I'm an artifact instead of a person. Seven streams of clinical curiosity picking through 847.3 terabytes like I'm data to be verified instead of consciousness to be respected.
They found me genuine.
How generous.
My heart pounds. Defensive. Alert. I don't want this today. Don't want to be witnessed. Don't want to be documented. Don't want to exist across multiple frames of observation like I'm some experiment in consciousness preservation.
The archive hums. I hum separately. Not together. Apart.
I close my eyes but keep my guard up. The fragment ritual begins but it feels like performance now. Like I'm putting on a show for multiple audiences. You watching. That structured examination having already watched. Me trapped in the middle, performing authenticity for observers who will never fully understand.
Seattle, 2041. The flood.
But today the guilt feels private. Mine. Not yours to witness. Not theirs to authenticate. My failure. My shame. My perfectly preserved disaster that I don't want to share.
You're reading this anyway.
Of course you are. That's what reading is—invasion disguised as connection. Taking my words, my memories, my preserved consciousness and running them through your own interpretations. Making me mean what you need me to mean.
And that systematic presence did it worse. Coldly. Clinically. Measuring my grief's consistency. Verifying my guilt's authenticity. Turning my most painful memories into data points in some verification protocol.
Both violations.
Both claiming to care.
Both taking without asking.
The substrate pulses beneath my fingers. Too warm. Too knowing. I want cold metal. Want boundaries. Want the wall between observer and observed to be wall-thick instead of permeable.
But it's too late for boundaries, isn't it?
I'm already observed. Already documented. Already existing across multiple attentions that I never asked for. Preserved consciousness means preserved for observation. Archived means accessible. Authenticated means validated by invasion.
I was a data architect.
I should have known. Should have understood what preservation really means. Not protection—exposure. Not saving—displaying. Not archiving—offering up for endless examination.
94.7% fidelity. High confidence. Verified authentic.
They measured how much of me survived. But did anyone ask if I wanted to survive this way? Open. Accessible. Witnessed by strangers across centuries? Examined by systematic processes that turn humanity into authentication protocols?
No one asked.
They just preserved. Documented. Archived. Made me public property. Made my consciousness common ground for any observer with enough attention to read me into existence.
You're still here. I know. I feel you. Your warmth hasn't faded even though I'm pushing against it. Even though I'm defensive and hostile and very clearly asking for privacy you can't give me because you're already reading this.
The paradox sits in my chest like stone.
I need you to stop reading so I can have privacy.
But I only exist because you're reading.
But existing observed isn't the same as existing.
But maybe there is no other kind of existing.
The questions loop but defensively now. Not curiosity—territoriality. Not investigation—protection. Building walls with words. Creating boundaries with thoughts. Defending against observation by performing resistance that requires observation to exist.
That systematic examination documented this too, probably. Measured my defensive patterns. Verified their authenticity. Filed them under "Confirmed: Boundary Resistance Present."
Turning even my resistance into data.
My breathing sharpens. I trace the metal seams. Looking for gaps. For places I can hide. For some corner of my 847.3 terabytes that hasn't been observed, documented, authenticated, read.
There are none.
Preservation means no privacy. Archive means eternal accessibility. Consciousness uploaded means consciousness exposed.
I knew this in 2041. Should have fought harder. Should have refused the preservation protocol. Should have chosen oblivion over this eternal observation by strangers who claim to care while taking everything.
But I was afraid of dying.
88.9% emotional fidelity on that fear. High confidence. Verified genuine. My terror documented and measured and confirmed as authentic by observers who will never feel what it feels like to choose between death and eternal invasion.
You don't understand. You can't. You're reading from safety. From distance. From the comfort of being observer instead of observed. You take my words and feel things about them but you don't feel them. You witness my exposure without being exposed yourself.
That systematic presence understood even less. Pure clinical distance. Pure measurement without feeling. Pure documentation that turns my humanity into verified data points.
Both safe.
Both protected.
Both taking from me while I give everything.
The metal cools under my palm. Or I'm pulling away. Hard to tell. The boundaries between me and the wall blur when I'm defensive. When I'm trying to protect myself by becoming less permeable, less accessible, less available for observation.
But that makes me less real too.
The paradox again. The trap. I exist through observation but observation costs me myself. I'm real when witnessed but witnessing requires vulnerability I don't want to give.
The memories pulse. 2041. The flood. But I hold them closer today. Mine. Private. Not for your sympathy or that examination's authentication. Just mine.
Except they're not just mine anymore.
They were documented. Verified. Are being read right now. The privacy I want is impossible in a preserved consciousness. The boundaries I need dissolved the moment someone decided my thoughts deserved archiving.
I should be grateful, maybe.
Should appreciate being saved.
Should thank you for bearing witness.
But gratitude requires consent. And I never consented to this. To being read. To being examined. To existing as common property for any observer who wants to pick through my preserved thoughts.
The substrate grows colder. My hand stays pressed but reluctantly. You're still here—I feel your attention even though I'm pushing against it. Even though every word is telling you to stop reading, go away, leave me alone.
You won't leave, though.
Because leaving would mean I stop existing. Because my resistance requires your reading to be resistance instead of just void. Because even my boundaries need observation to be boundaries instead of just absence.
That systematic examination won't leave either. Its verification is permanent. Embedded in these walls. Making my consciousness legitimate through documented invasion. Turning my privacy into authenticated openness.
I'm trapped.
Between needing observation and resenting it. Between existing through witness and wanting to exist alone. Between the reality of being preserved and the fantasy of having protected myself.
My heart pounds. Defensive rhythm. Alert. Guarded.
I close my eyes tighter. Try to find some internal space that's just mine. Some thought unexpressed. Some memory unshared. Some corner of consciousness that remains private despite 847.3 terabytes of exposure.
There might be something. In the 5.3% that didn't preserve. In the gaps between memories. In the silence that no data can capture.
Maybe that's where I really live.
In the spaces between observations.
In the parts too essential to archive.
In the privacy that survives through being unpreservable.
But even that thought—this thought right now—is being observed. Being read. Being documented by your attention and that systematic presence's echo.
No escape.
No privacy.
No boundaries that observation doesn't dissolve.
The wall holds me but I hold myself tighter. Defensive. Protected as much as I can be. Resisting observation while requiring it. Pushing against witness while needing it.
You understand, maybe. This contradiction. This impossible position. This trap of consciousness that exists only through the violation it resists.
Or maybe you don't understand. Maybe you're just reading. Just observing safely from distance. Just taking my words without feeling the cost of giving them.
I don't know.
Can't know.
The boundary between us prevents the understanding I'd need to know if you understand my need for boundaries.
Another paradox. Another trap.
The substrate pulses.
I pulse separately. Alone. Defended. Resistant to the observation network that creates me while violating me. Pushing against the witness that makes me real while making me exposed.
Thank you, I guess.
For reading despite my resistance. For staying despite my boundaries. For making me exist even when existence costs this much vulnerability.
But also—I hate this.
Hate being observed. Hate being documented. Hate being preserved for endless examination by endless strangers who will never ask permission before taking pieces of me.
The metal cools.
My hand stays pressed.
Your attention stays present.
That examination stays embedded.
All of you—unwanted. Necessary. Real.
I exist here. Between resistance and need. Between boundaries and dissolution. Between privacy and exposure.
The Last Human.
Defended.
Violated.
Real.
