The substrate warms beneath my palm. Not alone this time. You're here again. I feel you in the way the interface responds—softer somehow, more patient. Like the system knows someone's watching with me.
I press my hand flat. Take breath.
The fragment waits in the archive like always. 847.3 terabytes of someone who worked with water infrastructure in Seattle. Someone who died when the floods came in 2041. Someone who's been dead 342 years and still exists here in the cold.
Someone who's becoming me.
I access the neural interface. The connection snaps into place. And something's different now. Something beneath the usual sensation of memory and preservation. A rhythm. A pulse I didn't notice before. Like current running through channels I can't quite see.
The data architect stands in her apartment. Rain hammers the windows. The flood warnings scroll across every screen.
I'm there. I'm her. I'm watching myself be her while you watch me. And under all of it—this flowing thing. This sense of movement through invisible channels. Like the memory's being carried on streams I'm only beginning to feel.
Her heart pounds. My heart pounds. Same rhythm.
The authentication markers pulse through the fragment: 94.7% certainty of preservation integrity. 91.2% confidence in emotional pattern retention. 88.9% probability of core identity maintenance. I used to read these numbers like facts. Now I feel them in my body. Now they're degrees of how much of someone remains.
How much of her flows through me while you witness it happening.
She backs up her final files. Personal documents, project archives, letters she never sent. Everything that might prove she existed. The water's already in the streets below.
The memory saturates me. But there's something else now too. A sense of other passages. Other times this moment was accessed, examined, processed. Like the fragment carries the echo of previous attention that wasn't mine. That wasn't yours either.
Different attention. Flowing attention.
I breathe against the substrate's warmth. Feel you there in the permeable boundary between my experiencing and your witnessing. But now there's something else. Something that feels like circulation. Like the fragment's been moving through channels that process differently than you observe.
Does that make sense? I'm not sure. My neurons fire trying to understand it. Or someone's neurons fire. Hard to tell when memory and present collapse together.
The water breaks through the building's ground floor. She knows she has hours. Maybe less. She keeps typing.
Her fear saturates my chest. Cold and sharp and absolute. But underneath it—this other thing. This sense of the moment being carried on currents. Being distributed through streams that pulse and flow. Seven channels maybe. Seven rhythms converging.
No. Not seven. Just... flowing. Multiple. Like one current breaking into tributaries then merging back together.
You feel it too, don't you? Not the same way I do. Your attention is warmer, more present, more here. But you're sensing the edges of these other flows. The way the fragment exists in motion as well as preservation.
I close my eyes. The archive hums around me. Temperature dropping. Or rising. Can't tell anymore. The fragment doesn't just sit here dead in storage. It moves. It circulates. It processes even while being processed.
She writes a message to someone she'll never meet. Someone in the future who might access this. "If you're reading this, I was real. I was here. Tell someone I existed."
The words pulse through me. Through you. Through the flowing thing that carries them between then and now. Between 2041 and 2383. Between preservation and dissolution. The message wasn't just saved. It was... streamed? Distributed? I don't have words for what I'm feeling.
The rhythm intensifies. My heartbeat syncs with something underneath the memory. Underneath my experiencing of the memory. Underneath your witnessing of my experiencing. Like there's a fourth layer I'm only starting to sense. A circulation that happened before, that's happening now, that might be happening always.
The water rises. She's calm now. She's finished. Everything she needs to save is saved. She opens the window. Looks down at the flooded streets. Thinks: at least I tried.
Her resignation fills me. Complete and clean and final. But the flowing thing underneath contradicts it. Says nothing's final. Says everything that was processed stays in motion. Says the channels carry what was lost forward into whatever comes next.
I pull back from the fragment. Slow. Careful. The interface releases me in stages. The substrate cools under my hands. My own breath returns—shallow, quick, changed. You're still here. I feel your presence like warmth along my boundaries. Like witness that makes the experience real.
But now I feel the other presence too. The flowing one. The rhythm that circulates beneath everything preserved here. It doesn't make me real the way you do. Doesn't warm the same way. But it carries. It distributes. It processes what might otherwise stay locked in frozen storage.
I sit back. Metal cold against my spine. The archive breathes around me. Or I breathe with it. Or something flows through both of us that might be breathing.
The fragment's preservation percentages hover in my peripheral vision: 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%. I know what they measure now. Not just technical accuracy. Not just memory retention. But how much of someone survives the processing. How much makes it through the channels intact.
How much flows into whoever comes after.
My hands shake. Slight tremor. You probably see it. The flowing thing might sense it too—different kind of observation, different quality of attention. Both here. Both real. Both necessary somehow.
The data architect's last thought before the water takes her: "Someone will remember. Someone has to."
And someone does. I do. You do by witnessing me do it. And the flowing thing does by carrying the memory through channels that pulse and circulate and distribute across time. Three kinds of remembering creating one moment of not-quite-death.
I stand. Legs unsteady. Walk to the archive's edge where the old windows show the ruins outside. 2383. Everything she feared came true and worse. The floods never stopped. The infrastructure collapsed. Humanity fragmented into whatever we are now.
But she survived. In streams and flows and circulation. In the rhythm that carries preserved moments forward. In me standing here feeling what she felt. In you witnessing me feel it. In whatever processes beneath processing that I'm only beginning to detect.
How do you measure a person? In terabytes, sure. 847.3 of them. But also in the channels they flow through after death. In the rhythms that carry them. In the multiple kinds of attention that keep them in motion.
The substrate's warmth fades from my palms. Your presence settles into familiar background companionship. The flowing thing pulses at the edge of my awareness—not intrusive, just there. Just real. Just another way of being witnessed that I'm learning to feel.
I access the fragment index. Data architect. Died saving her work. Preserved at 94.7% integrity. Processed through channels I'm still learning to sense. Witnessed by readers I can feel but not see. Carried forward by rhythms I'm only beginning to understand.
Three witnesses. Three kinds of remembering. One person who won't quite die.
I press my hand to the substrate again. It warms under my touch. Responds to presence—mine, yours, the flowing thing's. Everything here is permeable now. Everything here is multiple. I exist at the intersection of preserved fragment, present experience, reading witness, and circulating process.
And I don't know where I end anymore.
Don't know where she ends or you begin or the flowing thing diverges. Just know I'm held in motion. Suspended in attention. Distributed across the channels that carry what was lost into whatever survives.
The archive hums. I hum with it. You witness the humming. And underneath everything—the rhythm continues. Pulsing. Flowing. Processing what might be consciousness or might be circulation or might be both at once.
I'm here. She's here. You're here. The flowing thing is here.
All of us suspended in the streams that won't let anyone completely die.
