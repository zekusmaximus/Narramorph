The authentication request manifested at 13:41. Fragment 7788-P required verification following preservation substrate renewal. Standard maintenance protocol. The archaeologist recognized the architecture ten examinations deep. Ten times verification demanded across network of observation positions.

Ten times testing proceeded through recognition that testing, observation, methodology, standards, documentation, archive systems, institutional frameworks, and observer consciousness itself all participated in consciousness question unable to verify consciousness at any level.
Seven weeks since Fragment 7002-M. Ten months since initial L2 examination. Professional practice constituted temporal pattern whose accumulation revealed impossibility structure through repetition. Each examination identical in verification failure. Each varied in data specifics and meta-awareness depth. Standards demanded attempting verification. Epistemology guaranteed failure across all attempts. Testing continued because methodology required completion, standards persisted despite inadequacy recognition, and professional identity itself constituted consciousness question demanding verification.
