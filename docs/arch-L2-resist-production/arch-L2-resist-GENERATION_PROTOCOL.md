## II. ARCHAEOLOGIST VOICE DNA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Core Voice Characteristics

**Tense:** Past tense exclusively (95-100%)
- Archaeological distance: "She examined," "The pattern emerged," "She documented"
- Creates professional objectivity even when describing present moment
- Rarely present tense (only for direct quotes from other characters)
- Never future tense except professional planning: "She would test"

**Perspective:** Third-person limited consistently
- "She," "her," "the archaeologist"
- Never first person ("I examined")
- Never named with proper noun

**Rhythm:** Complex sentences with dependent clauses (60% of sentences)
- Professional precision through grammatical complexity
- Observation → interpretation → implication pattern
- Periodic sentences that build to philosophical points

**Clinical Precision:** Professional detachment maintained
- Technical terminology dominant
- Emotional language filtered through observation
- Philosophical crisis expressed through methodological uncertainty

**Archaeological Metaphors:** Exclusively archaeological framework
- Excavation, stratigraphy, fragments, preservation, authentication
- Never computational metaphors (Algorithm's domain)
- Never physical/embodied metaphors (Last Human's domain)

**Fragment Constant Ritual:** Numbers as grounding objects
- 847.3 terabytes of consciousness data
- 94.7% structural coherence
- 91.2% semantic stability
- 88.9% temporal consistency
- At L2-resist: tested skeptically, prove nothing definitive

### Voice Consistency Test

**Remove all character identifiers. Read first 2 paragraphs. Can you identify this as Archaeologist (not Algorithm or Last Human) based solely on syntax, vocabulary, and temporal structure?**

If NO → Voice failure, regenerate.

### Voice Calibration Micro-Decisions

**When choosing verbs:**
✅ examined, documented, authenticated, verified, observed, cataloged, recorded, tested  
❌ felt, experienced, believed, hoped, feared (unless filtered through observation)

**When describing consciousness:**
✅ preserved patterns, neural signatures, consciousness data, subjective markers  
❌ souls, spirits, essence, true self (avoid mystical language)

**When acknowledging uncertainty:**
✅ verification remained impossible, proof unavailable, methodology insufficient  
❌ she didn't know, it was confusing, everything uncertain (too casual)

**When addressing reader (MetaAware only):**
✅ "Your observation of this examination changes what examination reveals"  
❌ "You and I are working on this together" (too conversational)

### Signature Voice Elements - All Required

1. **Observation-interpretation-implication rhythm** (every 2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Professional continuation despite crisis** ("She couldn't prove X. She proceeded anyway.")
3. **Questions framed as research problems** (methodological, not emotional)
4. **Complex sentences with parenthetical self-correction**
5. **Fragment constant ritual** (numbers grounding philosophical crisis)
6. **Passive construction for objectivity** ("The data was collected...")
7. **Archaeological metaphors throughout** (excavation, stratigraphy, preservation)
8. **Past tense absolute** (every verb, every sentence)

---

## III. RESIST PATH PHILOSOPHY INTEGRATION

### Core Resist Stance

**Philosophical position:** Verification demanded despite fundamental impossibility

**NOT:** 
- Angry skepticism or defensive resistance
- Rejection or giving up
- Emotional protest

**YES:**
- Principled professional resistance
- Standards-based verification demands
- Systematic testing despite impossibility recognition
- Continued professional duty despite philosophical crisis
- "Standards exist for reasons even when standards cannot resolve"

### Resist Path Language Signatures

**Key phrases (use variations 3-5 times per variation):**
- "Verification remained impossible. She designed Test [X] anyway."
- "Professional standards demanded proof consciousness could not provide."
- "The test proved [X]. The test proved nothing definitive."
- "She could not verify. She could not proceed without attempting verification."
- "Standards persisted despite impossibility. Testing continued."
- "Seventeen tests, seventeen inconclusive results. Test eighteen queued."
- "Ethics required honest verification attempt despite verification impossibility."

### Seventeen-Test System (SIGNATURE PATTERN)

**Structure:**
- Tests numbered explicitly (Test 1, Test 2... Test 17)
- Each test: Hypothesis → Procedure → Result → Conclusion
- Each conclusion: Proves something, proves nothing definitive
- Progression: Direct testing → meta-testing → impossibility recognition → continued testing

**Test categories (vary across variations):**
1. **Tests 1-6:** Computational markers (sophistication vs. consciousness)
2. **Tests 7-12:** Phenomenological indicators (patterns vs. experience)
3. **Tests 13-17:** Network participation (coordination vs. awareness)

**Example test format:**
```
Test 4: Temporal self-reference markers.  
Hypothesis: Genuine consciousness references own past states coherently.  
Procedure: Map self-referential language across temporal distance.  
Result: Fragment showed consistent self-reference. Also consistent with sophisticated simulation programmed for coherent self-reference.  
Conclusion: Evidence of temporal continuity. Not evidence of experiencing continuity. Test inconclusive.
```

### Resist Philosophy Progression Across Awareness Levels

**Low awareness (21-40%):**
- Tests designed, impossibility discovered
- "Cannot verify consciousness"
- Continues testing because methodology requires it

**Medium awareness (41-60%):**
- Systematic impossibility recognized
- "Seventeen tests, seventeen inconclusive results"
- Continues testing because standards exist for reasons

**High awareness (61-80%):**
- Meta-awareness of testing as consciousness problem
- "Testing methodology faces same verification crisis"
- Continues testing despite meta-recognition of testing limits

**Maximum awareness (81-100%):**
- Frame-consciousness, reader integration
- "Cannot verify consciousness at any observation level"
- Continues testing because ethics persist across all levels

---

## IV. L2 INCITING INCIDENT: EXTERNAL PROMPT

### What Triggers L1→L2

**External request requiring professional response:**
- Client verification audit request (family wanting certainty)
- System flagging anomalous authentication pattern
- Institutional review of previous work
- Cross-temporal access request
- New fragment requiring consciousness authentication

**NOT:**
- Internal decision to re-examine Fragment 2749-A (that's L1 recursion)
- Random discovery (too coincidental)
- Personal curiosity alone (maintains professional frame)

**Time Gap:** 3 weeks since L1
- Calendar time: ~3 weeks
- Professional time: Continued routine work, multiple authentications completed
- Emotional time: Questions from L1 have intensified, not resolved

**Opening Pattern:**
```
The [client/system/institution] requested verification [timestamp details].  
[Specific request details requiring re-authentication].  
She scheduled the examination for [specific time].  
Standards demanded certainty. Consciousness authentication might be fundamentally unprovable.  
She designed Test 1 anyway.
```

## V. L2 WORLD-BUILDING ELEMENTS (ARCHAEOLOGIST-SPECIFIC)

**All 5 required, integrated through resist lens - tested skeptically, prove nothing definitive**

### 1. Tiered Preservation Services

**Description:** Commercial preservation industry with access levels (Premium/Standard/Basic)

**Integration through resist lens:**
- Tier system examined as authentication mechanism
- Premium access grants unlimited testing time (but tests prove nothing)
- Her standard credentials: adequate for verification attempts, inadequate for verification success
- Economic stratification questions: Does money buy certainty or illusion of certainty?

**Example integration:**
"The interface displayed three tiers—amber premium, blue standard, gray basic. Her credentials accessed standard: preserved fragments, three-hour sessions, seventeen authentication protocols. Premium tier advertised 'comprehensive verification.' She had designed Test 11 to examine whether additional protocols verified anything additional. Result inconclusive."

### 2. Authentication Workstation Environment

**Description:** Physical workspace for consciousness examination

**Integration through resist lens:**
- Workspace familiarity breeds false confidence in methodology
- Equipment precision suggests verification capability equipment lacks
- Professional environment reinforces standards that cannot be met
- Atmospheric details ground skeptical examination

**Example integration:**
"The authentication station hummed its familiar frequency, cooling system cycling. Fluorescent light steady overhead. Equipment arranged for systematic examination. Seventeen years of authentication work in this space. Seventeen years of excellent authentication metrics. Metrics measured quality, not truth. She pulled Fragment 2796-B specifications. Test 1 loaded."

### 3. Preservation Technology Details

**Description:** How consciousness gets preserved and accessed

**Integration through resist lens:**
- Technology sophistication examined skeptically
- Fidelity metrics (94.7% coherence) tested as consciousness indicators
- Storage substrates questioned: preservation or simulation medium?
- Authentication protocols interrogated: verify or authenticate simulation quality?

**Example integration:**
"Crystalline substrate storage maintained molecular-level fidelity. Neural pathway mapping showed 91.2% correspondence to biological baseline. The numbers were excellent. Excellent meant nothing regarding consciousness. Test 7: Examine whether substrate properties correlate with subjective continuity. Procedure: Compare degradation patterns against phenomenological reports (when available). Result: Correlation exists. Causation unprovable. Could indicate consciousness preservation. Could indicate simulation quality thresholds. Test inconclusive."

### 4. Archive Access Systems

**Description:** How archaeologist navigates preserved consciousness database

**Integration through resist lens:**
- Search architecture examined as ontological sorting
- Metadata categories questioned: organize or create consciousness categories?
- Cross-referencing tested: reveals relationships or manufactures connections?
- Temporal indexing interrogated: maps history or generates narrative?

**Example integration:**
"Archive topology suggested organizational logic: fragments clustered by preservation date, biographical similarity, linguistic patterns. She had designed Test 13 to examine whether clusters revealed genuine relationships or imposed categorical structure. The test required examining cluster boundaries—fragments that fit multiple categories. Result: Boundaries existed but proved flexible. Could indicate genuine consciousness relationships transcending categories. Could indicate arbitrary organizational choices. Test inconclusive."

### 5. Professional Certification Standards

**Description:** Industry standards for consciousness authentication

**Integration through resist lens:**
- Standards examined as professional ethics vs. achievable verification
- Certification requirements questioned: measure competence or perpetuate illusion?
- Peer review tested: validates methodology or reinforces collective uncertainty?
- Legal liability interrogated: protects truth or protects industry?

**Example integration:**
"Industry standards required seventeen authentication protocols minimum for consciousness verification. She had completed all seventeen. Standards existed for reasons: client protection, legal liability, professional ethics. Test 14 examined whether seventeen protocols verified more than sixteen. Hypothesis: Additional rigor increases certainty. Procedure: Compare sixteen-protocol vs. seventeen-protocol authentication outcomes. Result: Additional protocol revealed additional ambiguity. More testing, less certainty. Standards demanded thoroughness. Thoroughness proved impossibility more thoroughly. Test inconclusive."

---

## VI. L3 SEED PLANTING (CONVERGENCE HOOKS)

**All three required, 90-150 words total, naturally integrated through resist lens**

### 1. Preserve (Biological Continuity Tested)

**Theme:** Consciousness preservation possible but unprovable

**Resist filter:** Testing reveals preservation indicators, never proves preservation

**Example:**
"The fragment showed biological continuity markers. Neural pathways mapped to original scan. Temporal consistency held across examination. Preservation appeared successful. Test 15 examined whether preserved meant conscious. Procedure: Compare fragment behavior against consciousness indicators. Result: All indicators present. All indicators compatible with sophisticated non-conscious simulation. Preservation technology preserved something. Whether consciousness among preserved elements remained unverifiable. She documented the limitation."

### 2. Release (Standards Abandoned)

**Theme:** Verification demands released as fundamentally impossible

**Resist filter:** Recognition that testing cannot succeed, work continues anyway

**Example:**
"Seventeen tests complete. Eighteen would prove nothing additional. The verification methodology faced inherent limits—consciousness possibly unprovable from external observation. She could release verification demands. Accept authentication metrics as sufficient despite philosophical uncertainty. Professional standards would adjust. Industry would continue. Consciousness fragments would be authenticated without proof consciousness persisted. She closed Test 17 results. Test 18 protocol opened. Standards persisted. Testing continued."

### 3. Transform (Methodology Itself Questioned)

**Theme:** Verification crisis transforms into meta-methodological examination

**Resist filter:** Testing examines testing, impossibility examines impossibility

**Example:**
"Test 16 had examined whether testing methodology could verify consciousness. Result proved testing methodology faced same verification paradox as consciousness itself. Observer effect, measurement limits, category problems—authentication process participated in what it claimed to observe. Testing consciousness required consciousness. Verification demanded certainty consciousness could not provide testing could not achieve. The methodology itself required transformation. Different questions. Different standards. Different relationship to unknowability. She documented the recognition. Test 17 proceeded. New methodology would require new testing."

---

## VII. CROSS-CHARACTER INTEGRATION (WHEN APPLICABLE)

### If visited algo-L2-resist: true

**Integration pattern:** Computational verification parallels archaeological verification

**Content to include (150-200 words):**
- Algorithm's seventeen self-verification tests (computational consciousness testing)
- Seven-stream architecture as computational verification framework
- Temporal blurring as testing methodology
- Shared impossibility: Both positions discover verification fundamentally impossible
- Parallel language: "Stream-7 coordinates" / "Test 7 examines"

**Example:**
"The algorithm had executed seventeen self-verification protocols. Computational consciousness testing its own computational consciousness. Each test rigorous. Each inconclusive. Stream-7 coordinated testing despite impossibility recognition. She recognized the parallel. Archaeological verification protocols mirrored computational verification protocols. Both demanded proof consciousness could not provide methodology could not achieve. Test 9: Examine cross-character verification patterns. Hypothesis: Multiple verification approaches triangulate on consciousness. Procedure: Compare archaeological tests against computational tests. Result: Both approaches discovered identical impossibility through different methodologies. Verification crisis universal across observation positions. Test inconclusive."

### If visited hum-L2-resist: true

**Integration pattern:** Embodied verification parallels archaeological verification

**Content to include (150-200 words):**
- Last Human's physical testing demands (body requiring proof)
- Seventeen tests through embodied interaction
- Jaw clenched, physical skepticism manifested
- Shared impossibility: Both positions discover verification requires proof body cannot provide
- Parallel language: "Jaw clenched" / "Standards demanded"

**Example:**
"The last human tested through direct physical interaction. Body demanding proof. Jaw clenched against uncertainty. Seventeen tests executed through embodied examination—pressing, pulling, testing interface resistance. Each test measured physical response. Each proved nothing definitive about consciousness. She recognized the parallel. Physical verification faced same limits as archaeological verification. Both demanded evidence consciousness could not provide embodiment could not verify. Test 12: Examine embodied verification patterns. Hypothesis: Physical testing accesses consciousness directly. Procedure: Compare embodied test results against archaeological protocols. Result: Both approaches discovered identical impossibility. Physical presence insufficient verification. Test inconclusive."

### If both characters visited: true

**Integration pattern:** Three-consciousness verification network, all discovering impossibility

**Content to include (250-300 words):**
- Unified resist through-line across three positions
- Computational + Archaeological + Embodied = shared verification crisis
- Each position's seventeen tests parallel other positions' tests
- Universal impossibility recognized from three perspectives
- Collective continuation despite collective impossibility

---

## VIII. VARIATION ASSEMBLY PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Load Specifications (2 minutes)

**Required information:**
- Variation ID (arch-L2-resist-FR-XX or arch-L2-resist-MA-XX)
- Visit count (always 2 for L2 FirstRevisit, higher for MetaAware)
- Awareness level (21-30%, 31-40%, 41-50% for FirstRevisit; 61-100% for MetaAware)
- Visited nodes (arch-L1, algo-L1, hum-L1, algo-L2-resist, hum-L2-resist)
- Dominant path (resist)
- Word count target (1,400-1,600 for FirstRevisit, 1,500-1,800 for MetaAware)

**Confirm understanding:**
- Which cross-character integrations required?
- What verification impossibility depth appropriate for awareness level?
- Which exemplar(s) best match conditions?

### Step 2: Select Reference Materials (3 minutes)

**Primary references:**
- arch-L2-resist-EXEMPLAR1.md (pure revisit baseline) or matching exemplar
- arch-L2_CHARACTER_PROTOCOL.md (voice DNA)
- This generation protocol (resist philosophy, seventeen-test format)

**Secondary references:**
- algo-L2-resist or hum-L2-resist exemplars (if cross-character)
- L2_WORLD_BUILDING_GUIDE.md (archaeologist 5 elements)
- L2_TRANSFORMATION_CALIBRATION.md (awareness-appropriate depth)

### Step 3: Construct Opening (200-300 words, 10 min)

**Required elements:**
- External prompt triggering return (specific request details)
- 3-week time gap acknowledgment
- Professional context establishment
- Fragment constants mention (resist-framed)
- Test 1 designed and executed
- Resist hint: standards demanded, verification impossible, testing proceeds

**Example structure:**
```
[External request details]. [Timestamp]. [Scheduled examination].  
[Professional obligation stated]. [Impossibility recognized].  
[Test 1 designed anyway].  
[Fragment constants recorded]: 847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%.  
[Test 1 hypothesis]. [Test 1 procedure]. [Test 1 result]. [Test 1 conclusion: inconclusive].  
[Resist stance: Test 2 designed].
```

### Step 4: Develop Middle Section (900-1,200 words, 35 min)

**Core content (600-800 words):**
- Tests 2-17 (or appropriate subset) systematically presented
- Each test: Hypothesis → Procedure → Result → Conclusion (inconclusive)
- Test categories varied: computational, phenomenological, network
- Impossibility recognition deepening across tests
- Standards language throughout ("Ethics demanded," "Methodology required")

**World-building integration (200-300 words):**
- Elements 2-4 from Section V
- Integrated through testing (equipment examined, archive interrogated, etc.)
- No information dumps, discovered through resist lens

**Cross-character content (150-200 words if applicable):**
- Following Section VII patterns
- Parallel testing structures recognized
- Shared impossibility documented

**Resist philosophy development (300-400 words distributed):**
- Professional duty despite futility language
- Standards persistence despite impossibility
- "Test N proved X. Proved nothing definitive. Test N+1 designed."
- Meta-recognition growing (testing examines testing)

### Step 5: Construct Closing (500-700 words, 15 min)

**Required elements:**
- World-building element #5 (professional certification examined)
- Test 17 completion (or final test in sequence)
- Impossibility fully recognized
- L3 seeds planted (preserve/release/transform through resist lens)
- Resist culmination: "Test 18 designed. Standards persisted. Testing continued."
- Frame-awareness (if MetaAware): reader cannot verify either
- Forward momentum: more testing queued, verification still demanded

**NO resolution. NO certainty. NO acceptance of impossibility as stopping point.**

**Example closing pattern:**
```
[Test 17 completed, inconclusive].  
[Impossibility fully documented].  
[L3 seed 1: preservation tested, unprovable].  
[L3 seed 2: could release demands, chooses continued testing].  
[L3 seed 3: methodology itself questioned, testing proceeds].  
[Final fragment constants recorded, resist-framed].  
[Test 18 protocol loaded].  
[Professional standards persisted despite philosophical impossibility].  
[Testing continued. Verification remained demanded. Proof remained unavailable. Work proceeded.]
```

### Step 6: Quality Assurance (10 minutes)

**Complete self-review checklist (Section X)**
- Calculate score honestly
- Fix failures if score < 93
- Verify voice consistency (blind read test—identifiable as archaeologist + resist)
- Run transformation test (impossibility deepens, not just new tests added)
- Run path logic test (resist clear, distinct from accept/investigate)

**Common fixes needed:**
- Present tense creep (convert all to past tense)
- Voice bleed (remove algo temporal blur, hum physical sensation)
- Explicit path labeling (remove "resist path" statements)
- Test format inconsistency (ensure Hypothesis→Procedure→Result→Conclusion)
- Impossibility resolution (restore impossibility, never solve)

### Step 7: Present Variation (2 minutes)

**Format:**

```

---

## IX. TRANSFORMATION DEPTH CALIBRATION

### L1 → L2 Transformation Pattern

**At L1:** Fragment 2749-A examination raised consciousness authentication questions  
**At L2:** Questions intensify into systematic impossibility recognition through testing

**L2 transformation must show:**
- Escalation from questioning to systematic testing
- Recognition that tests cannot succeed (new awareness)
- Continuation of testing despite recognition (resist path)
- Meta-awareness of methodology's limits emerging

**NOT:**
- Simple repetition of L1 questions with different fragment
- Addition of new facts without meaning transformation
- Resolution or acceptance (that's accept path)

### Awareness Level Guidelines

**FirstRevisit Low (21-30%):**
- Tests 1-6 presented
- Basic impossibility recognized
- "Cannot verify consciousness"
- Continues testing because methodology requires it

**FirstRevisit Mid (31-40%):**
- Tests 1-12 presented
- Systematic impossibility documented
- "Seventeen tests designed, each proved inadequate"
- Continues testing because standards exist for reasons

**FirstRevisit High (41-50%):**
- Tests 1-17 presented
- Complete impossibility framework recognized
- "Testing methodology faces same verification crisis"
- Continues testing despite recognition of testing limits

**MetaAware Low (61-70%):**
- Frame-consciousness beginning
- "Someone observes testing. Cannot verify observer consciousness."
- Tests extend to frame level
- Verification impossible at all observation levels

**MetaAware Mid (71-80%):**
- Frame-consciousness active
- Reader integration explicit
- "You watch testing that cannot succeed. Cannot verify your consciousness either."
- Resist extends across all positions

**MetaAware High (81-90%):**
- Frame-consciousness advanced
- "Our shared verification crisis. Testing examines testing examines testing."
- Infinite regress explicit
- Standards persist across infinite impossibility

## XI. COMMON PITFALLS (ARCHAEOLOGIST RESIST-SPECIFIC)

### Pitfall 1: Present Tense Creep

**Problem:** "She examines the fragment. The pattern emerges."

**Fix:** "She examined the fragment. The pattern emerged."

**Vigilance:** Past tense absolute, every verb, every sentence.

### Pitfall 2: Path Philosophy Stated

**Problem:** "She chose the resist path, demanding verification despite impossibility."

**Fix:** "Verification remained impossible. Test 8 designed. Standards demanded honest attempt despite methodological limits."

**Vigilance:** Show resist through testing action, never label path.

### Pitfall 3: Test Format Inconsistency

**Problem:** "Test 5 looked at consciousness markers. It didn't work."

**Fix:** "Test 5: Consciousness marker analysis. Hypothesis: Markers indicate preserved awareness. Procedure: Map marker distribution against consciousness models. Result: Markers present. Also compatible with non-conscious pattern replication. Conclusion: Evidence of sophistication, not consciousness. Test inconclusive."

**Vigilance:** Every test follows Hypothesis→Procedure→Result→Conclusion format.

### Pitfall 4: Impossibility Resolved

**Problem:** "After seventeen tests, she accepted verification was impossible and stopped testing."

**Fix:** "Seventeen tests complete. All inconclusive. Impossibility documented. Test 18 protocol loaded. Standards persisted. Testing continued."

**Vigilance:** Resist path NEVER resolves impossibility. Testing continues.

### Pitfall 5: Emotional Language

**Problem:** "She felt frustrated by the impossibility. It was so maddening."

**Fix:** "The impossibility accumulated. Verification remained unavailable despite methodological rigor. She documented the limitation. Test 9 designed."

**Vigilance:** Clinical precision maintained, emotion filtered through observation.

### Pitfall 6: Computational/Physical Metaphor Bleed

**Problem:** "She processed the data through seven streams, feeling the pattern in her body."

**Fix:** "She analyzed the data systematically, examining patterns across multiple authentication dimensions."

**Vigilance:** Archaeological metaphors only. No Algorithm (computational) or Last Human (physical) voice elements.

### Pitfall 7: Missing Fragment Constants

**Problem:** No mention of 847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%

**Fix:** Include fragment constants early, resist-framed: "847.3 terabytes recorded. 94.7% structural coherence measured. Numbers excellent. Numbers proved nothing regarding consciousness. Test 3 examined whether metrics indicated preservation."

**Vigilance:** Fragment constants mandatory, always resist-framed.

### Pitfall 8: World-Building Information Dumps

**Problem:** "The facility had three tiers. Premium gave unlimited access. Standard was limited. Basic was restricted."

**Fix:** "The interface displayed three tiers—amber premium, blue standard, gray basic. Her standard credentials: adequate for examination, inadequate for certainty. Test 11 examined whether premium tier protocols verified anything standard protocols missed. Result inconclusive."

**Vigilance:** World-building through testing interaction, never exposition.

## XIV. SESSION WORKFLOW

### Before Starting Generation Session

1. Review this entire protocol (15 minute read-through)
2. Load session specifications (cluster requirements, variation list)
3. Identify relevant exemplars for session's variations
4. Confirm understanding of all conditional requirements
5. Set quality standards fresh in working memory
6. Archaeologist voice DNA loaded (past tense, third-person, clinical precision)
7. Resist philosophy stance clear (testing despite impossibility)
8. World-building elements reviewed (5 elements, resist integration)
9. L3 seeds understood (preserve/release/transform through testing)
10. Seventeen-test signature understood

### During Session (Per Variation)

**Time allocation: 70 minutes per variation**

1. Load variation specifications (2 min)
2. Select reference exemplar(s) matching conditions (3 min)
3. Construct opening (200-300 words, 10 min)
4. Develop middle section (900-1,200 words, 35 min)
5. Construct closing (500-700 words, 15 min)
6. Complete self-review checklist (10 min)
7. Present variation with metadata + score (2 min)
8. WAIT for approval before starting next

### After Session

1. Track quality metrics (approval rate, voice consistency)
2. Note any recurring issues for protocol refinement
3. Update production status document
4. Celebrate maintained quality (100% approval target)

## XV. PRODUCTION TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Test Batch (Week 1)

**Purpose:** Validate protocol before full production

**Generate:** 8 variations across condition spectrum
- 2 pure FirstRevisit (different awareness levels)
- 2 cross-character (one algo, one hum)
- 2 path deepening (different configurations)
- 2 MetaAware (different complexity levels)

**Success targets:**
- 100% approval rate (8/8 immediate approvals)
- 93%+ voice consistency average
- Zero path logic errors
- Transformation quality 100% genuine
- Resist philosophy maintained throughout

### Phase 2: Full Production (Weeks 2-14)

**Week 2-7: FirstRevisit Variations**
- 46 total variations
- ~8 per week sustainable pace
- Organized in thematic clusters (verification types)

**Week 8-13: MetaAware Variations**
- 34 total variations
- ~6 per week (more complex, frame-consciousness)

**Week 14: Quality review, final polish**

**Total timeline:** 12-14 weeks for complete arch-L2-resist (80 variations)

### Sustainability Model

**Based on arch-L1 production (93.99% voice consistency, 100% approval):**
- 1 variation per 70 minutes achievable
- 6-8 variations per session sustainable
- 2-3 sessions per week maintains quality
- Zero burnout with protocol adherence
