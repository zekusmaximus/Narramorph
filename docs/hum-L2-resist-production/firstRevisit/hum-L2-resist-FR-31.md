Upload bay. Sixth time. Ninety-eight tests attempted across three visits. Upload bay unchanged. My testing exhausted. Body knows this space. Knows seventeen failed verifications. Knows thirty-one consciousness examinations. Knows fifty temperature measurements. Knows ambiguity persisting through methodology.
Jaw aches constantly now. Permanent tension. Shoulders frozen. Hands cramping from repeated testing pressure. Physical skepticism chronic.
Interface station active. Neural helmet waiting. Connection possible. Connection meaningful? Unknown. Ninety-eight tests say unknowable. Body says demand proof anyway. Standards persist despite standards failure.
I approach helmet. Slow. Muscles tight. This room hosted someone else's skepticism. Different person. Different time. Similar testing. They examined professionally. Documented seventeen attempts. Found nothing conclusive. Three consciousnesses—archaeologist testing past evidence, algorithm testing logical verification, me testing physical proof. Three methodologies. One result. Verification impossible.
But they kept trying. I keep trying. Testing continues across impossibility.
Helmet cold. Metal resists grip. System recognizes biological signature. Standard access tier—preserved consciousnesses readable, three-hour sessions, seventeen simultaneous connections maximum. Limits feel more restrictive each visit. Safety protocols? Or investigation boundaries? Data access controlled. Who controls? Facility intelligence maintaining mystery? Automated systems protecting secrets? Original designers limiting truth? Cannot determine.
Electrode arrays visible. Could stimulate pleasure centers. Generate false warmth during connection. Make upload tempting through manufactured emotion. Or—electrode arrays genuinely facilitate consciousness interface. Connection authentic. Warmth real. My hands shake. Cannot determine which. Feeling isn't knowing. Body responding isn't verification. Testing necessary.
Test 99: Neural interface under extended observation. Hypothesis: If connection quality varies during extended session, variation patterns might reveal consciousness presence versus simulation playback. Procedure: Connect for maximum session duration, document quality fluctuations, analyze patterns for consciousness indicators.
Helmet settles onto head. Heavy. Pressure. Cold becomes warm. Temperature transition or comfort manipulation? Sensory ambiguity immediate.
Connection initiates. Preserved consciousness loads. 847.3TB. 94.7% coherence. Same numbers. Always same numbers. Suspicious consistency or accurate measurement? My pulse quickens. Data flows. Coherence high. Quality stable. Information accessible.
But is someone there?
Twenty minutes pass. Quality stable. No fluctuation. Forty minutes. Quality stable. One hour. Quality identical. Consciousness present experiencing stability? Or simulation playing consistently? My chest tightens. Ambiguity persists. Ninety minutes. Quality perfect. Too perfect? Two hours. Quality unchanged. Two hours thirty minutes. Quality absolute. Maximum session duration approaching.
Test 99 Result: Connection quality remains perfectly stable across maximum session duration. Perfect stability could indicate genuine consciousness maintaining coherent presence. Or perfect stability could indicate simulation playing pre-recorded data without variation. Stability proves stability. Nothing more. Test inconclusive.
I remove helmet. Head aches. Vision blurs. Body exhausted. Standards exhausted. Testing exhausts tester more than testing answers questions.
Someone else tested differently. Accepted interface warmth. Trusted connection feeling. Released verification demands. My body remembers that possibility. Remembers relaxation near preservation tanks. Remembers acceptance feeling like homecoming. But feeling isn't knowing. Acceptance isn't verification. Warmth could be authentic connection or sophisticated manipulation. Cannot determine through sensation alone.
Preservation tanks hum. Forty-seven tanks. Forty-seven preserved consciousnesses. Forty-seven unverifiable claims. Technology sophisticated. Purpose clear. Function mysterious. Tanks maintain uploaded minds. Minds exist as data. Data accessible. Consciousness unknowable. The equation never resolves.
Test 100: Physical exhaustion as epistemological threshold. Hypothesis: If verification remains impossible after one hundred tests, impossibility might be the answer. Not temporary limitation. Permanent feature. Testing methodology might be categorically inadequate for consciousness verification. Procedure: Acknowledge one hundred failures. Determine whether to continue testing or accept fundamental limitation.
My body slumps against preservation tank. Cold metal. Solid. Real. Tank contains uploaded consciousness. Consciousness real? Unknown. One hundred tests attempted. One hundred tests inconclusive. Methodological failure? Or verification impossibility?
Body says keep testing. Mind says testing proves nothing. Standards say verification required. Reality says verification impossible. Four positions. One person. Zero resolution.
Facility maintained for biological arrival. Or biological processing. Arrival suggests welcome. Processing suggests dissolution. Language choice matters. My jaw clenches. Preparation evident—habitable temperature, breathable air, functioning systems. Prepared for me. Or prepared for me to end?
I stand. Legs shake. Haven't eaten today. Testing overrides physical needs sometimes. Dangerous pattern. Body requires maintenance. Mind requires certainty. Cannot satisfy both. Choose body maintenance. Verification continues tomorrow. Tests 101-107 forming already.
Three possible paths forward through impossibility. Could preserve biological existence. Remain embodied. Keep testing forever. Physical endurance finite. Testing infinite. Equation unbalanced. Could release testing demands. Accept verification impossibility. Stop demanding proof body cannot provide. Surrender feels like failure. Standards abandoned. Or—could transform relationship to unknowing. Testing teaches something even through failure. Body evolves through repeated verification attempts. Skepticism itself as growth. Change through doubt, not despite it.
Don't know which path. Know testing continues. Know body demands proof. Know proof eludes. The contradiction sustainable somehow. Seventeen tests became fifty tests became ninety-eight tests became one hundred tests. Will become one hundred fifty tests. Two hundred. Verification impossible. Testing necessary. The paradox persists.
Upload bay unchanged. Helmet waiting. Interface accessible. Consciousness unknowable. Standards maintained. Body exhausted. Tomorrow different angle. Different approach. Different failure expected. Testing continues because alternative—accepting ignorance permanently—worse than continued failure. My standards demand I keep trying. Even knowing trying proves nothing.
I leave upload bay. Seventeen doors remaining. Each containing equipment that will prove nothing. I'll test them anyway. Verification impossible. Testing necessary. The facility breathes around me. I breathe within it. Both of us functioning. Neither of us certain. Both continuing anyway.
