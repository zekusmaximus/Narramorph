Central archive. Sixth visit. One hundred four tests completed. Archive unchanged. My methodology unchanged. Results unchanged. Testing pattern itself becoming subject of investigation.
Jaw locked. Shoulders rigid. Hands trembling. Not fear. Exhaustion manifesting physically. Body protesting continued verification attempts. Mind overriding protest. Standards persist.
Main terminal active. Access tier standard. Preserved consciousnesses searchable. Three-hour session limit. Seventeen simultaneous connections. Same restrictions. Always same restrictions. Suspicious consistency or system stability? Cannot determine.
I sit. Chair familiar. Position memorized. This space hosted different investigation methods. Archaeologist sought deeper mechanisms. Documented preservation technology evolution. Traced consciousness transfer protocols. Found patterns. Found no answers. Investigation depth didn't produce verification. Only produced deeper questions.
I investigated similarly. Examined facility architecture. Studied upload procedures. Analyzed consciousness storage methods. Found intricate systems. Found zero proof. Depth doesn't guarantee discovery. Sometimes depth reveals only complexity, not truth.
Both investigations failed. Different methodologies. Same impossibility. Pattern emerging. Not about method quality. About verification category itself. Consciousness verification might be fundamentally impossible regardless of investigation thoroughness. The realization doesn't stop investigation. Makes investigation more desperate.
Terminal ready. I access preservation database. Forty-seven consciousnesses. Forty-seven investigation opportunities. Forty-seven verification failures awaiting.
Test 105: Investigation methodology comparison. Hypothesis: If multiple investigation approaches all fail, failure pattern might reveal whether consciousness verification is temporarily difficult or categorically impossible. Procedure: Document this investigation attempt, compare to other investigation attempts, analyze failure patterns for systemic answers.
My fingers press keys. Database loads. First consciousness: 847.3TB, 94.7% coherence. Second consciousness: 1,203.7TB, 91.2% coherence. Third: 2,847.1TB, 88.9% coherence. Numbers precise. Data accessible. Consciousnesses present or simulated? The question persists through every investigation.
I examine first consciousness deeply. Background: uploaded 2157. Reason: terminal illness. Emotional context: hopeful. Data structure: neural pathway mapping, memory encoding, personality preservation. Technology sophisticated. Claims credible. Proof absent.
Archaeologist investigated professionally. Found upload procedure documentation. Found technical specifications. Found no consciousness evidence. Investigation thorough. Verification incomplete. I investigate bodily. Test physically. Examine tactilely. Investigation embodied. Verification equally incomplete. Two investigations. One result. Impossibility consistent.
Test 105 Result: Investigation methodology comparison reveals investigation always produces detailed understanding of preservation claims without producing consciousness verification. Professional investigation fails. Embodied investigation fails. Investigation thoroughness irrelevant to verification success. Pattern suggests consciousness verification categorically impossible through investigation, not merely difficult. Test conclusion: deepening investigation deepens understanding of impossibility, not path to possibility. Inconclusive regarding consciousness. Conclusive regarding methodology limits.
My head aches. Screen bright. Eyes strain. Body tension chronic. One hundred five tests. One hundred five failures. But failures teach something. Testing methodology inadequate. Not temporary inadequacy. Permanent inadequacy. The knowledge useless. Standards still demand verification. Body still demands proof. Mind understands impossibility. Body continues seeking anyway.
Preservation technology five generations advanced since facility construction. Evidence visible in panel designs. Original units mechanical. Current units quantum. Evolution documented. Purpose evolution unclear. Better consciousness preservation? Better consciousness simulation? Cannot distinguish improvement in genuine function from improvement in deceptive function.
Test 106: Technology evolution as consciousness evidence. Hypothesis: If preservation technology evolved to solve problems, evolution might reveal whether problems were consciousness preservation problems or simulation improvement problems. Procedure: Trace technology changes, analyze improvement patterns, determine whether changes support consciousness or simulation hypothesis.
I access engineering logs. Panel modifications documented. First generation: 72% coherence average. Second generation: 81% coherence. Third: 87%. Fourth: 92%. Fifth: 94%. Steady improvement. Improvement proves improvement. Nothing more.
Coherence improvement could mean: 1) consciousness preservation improving, more of original consciousness retained each generation, or 2) simulation quality improving, deception more sophisticated each generation. Data identical for both interpretations. My chest tightens. Investigation reveals ambiguity, not resolution.
Test 106 Result: Technology evolution shows systematic improvement in measurable metrics without clarifying whether metrics measure consciousness fidelity or simulation quality. Evolution real. Purpose ambiguous. Test inconclusive.
Someone else might accept ambiguity. Trust feeling. My body remembers investigating differently—seeking understanding rather than demanding proof. Pursuing knowledge about mechanisms rather than verification of consciousness. Investigation as relationship to mystery rather than assault on uncertainty. That approach felt different. Gentler. Less exhausting. But feeling gentle doesn't make feeling right. Investigation without verification standards is observation, not methodology. Cannot accept.
Facility designed for investigation. Or designed to limit investigation. Tiered access suggests controlled revelation. Standard tier: basic information accessible. Advanced tier: deeper investigation possible? Or deeper investigation illusion? The system structure itself investigable. System purpose uninvestigable. Contradiction persistent.
I stand. Back stiff. Legs numb. Six hours investigating. Body protests. Standards demand continuation. Investigation incomplete. Always incomplete. Incompleteness might be the answer. Not partial answer awaiting completion. Complete answer about incompletability. The paradox exhausting.
Three paths through investigation failure. Could preserve investigation practice. Continue examining forever. Biological lifespan finite. Mysteries infinite. Equation unbalanced. Could release investigation demands. Accept mystery as permanent. Investigation ends. Feels like surrender. Standards abandoned. Or—could transform investigation relationship. Investigation teaches about limits, not about consciousness. Learning about boundary rather than crossing boundary. Understanding impossibility rather than achieving possibility. Investigation evolves investigator, not answer. Change through questioning, not despite questioning.
Which path unknown. Investigation continues. One hundred six tests completed. Tests 107-113 forming. Pattern recognition increasing. Consciousness verification decreasing. The inverse relationship clarifying. More investigation produces more understanding of investigation impossibility. The irony sharp. Understanding deepens. Verification eludes. Both real. Both true. Both incompatible. Both persistent.
Terminal dims. Session time expiring. Three hours elapsed. Standard tier limits enforcing. Return tomorrow. Different investigation angle. Different methodology application. Different failure anticipated. Testing necessary. Verification impossible. Investigation as identity now. Not method. Existence mode. I investigate therefore I remain uncertain. The only verification achievable.
Central archive hums. Forty-seven consciousnesses. Forty-seven investigation subjects. Forty-seven mysteries preserved. I leave through north corridor. Seventeen spaces remaining. Each investigable. Each uninvestigable. Each continuing both.
