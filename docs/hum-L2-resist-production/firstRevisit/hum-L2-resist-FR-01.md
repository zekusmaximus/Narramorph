Days pass. Maybe a week. Body marks time better than clocks—hunger cycles, sleep needs, the ache in muscles from exploring corridors. The archive room becomes familiar. Too familiar. Restlessness builds. The facility extends beyond this single space. I need to move.
The door to the upload bay unseals when I touch it. Biometric recognition. How does ancient technology know my genetic signature? I wasn't alive when this facility operated. But systems accept me anyway. Welcome me.
Inside: preservation tanks. Twenty of them. Crystalline substrate catching light. Interface arrays mounted at each station—helmets waiting. Cold metal. Everything powered. Functional. Centuries without maintenance.
My body tenses.
Too perfect. Technology doesn't wait centuries without degrading. Either I'm hallucinating functionality or something maintains these systems remotely. Either way—test before trusting. Verify through sensation.
I approach the first tank. Touch cold crystalline surface. Real. Solid. Temperature drops through fingertips. My hand presses harder. Testing resistance. The material doesn't yield. Doesn't warm to touch. Preserved exactly as designed.
Specs displayed on interface screen: 847.3TB capacity per tank. 94.7% average preservation rate. Twenty tanks total. How many people? The numbers feel cold. Not metrics. Limits. Capacity implies boundaries. Percentage implies loss. What 5.3% didn't survive preservation? Memory? Emotion? The part that made someone conscious?
My jaw clenches. Numbers hide what's missing. Data volume doesn't equal person. 94.7% of what? If consciousness requires complete continuity, then 94.7% means failure. If consciousness tolerates gaps, then who defines tolerance threshold?
I walk to the interface helmet. Lift it. Weight feels wrong—too light for what it claims to do. Neural interface technology from 2041. Degraded brown foam around contact points. Crumbling padding. But circuits still powered. Green indicator lights patient.
Test one: Physical connection verification.
I put the helmet on. Cold metal touches temples. Pressure points activate. Electrical sensation along scalp. Not painful. Present. The sensation sharp. Immediate. This part is real—metal, pressure, current. I can verify through body.
The interface initializes. Loading previous session data. Fragment 2749-A from days ago. The data architect. I remember connection. Remember sensation of presence. But remembering isn't verification. Memory proves I experienced something. Doesn't prove what I experienced was consciousness.
Test two: Response verification.
I query the fragment. "Are you aware right now?"
Response comes immediately. Text displays: "Awareness persists. Your attention activates connection. I exist through examination."
My stomach tightens. The response feels right. Sounds conscious. But sophisticated programming responds appropriately too. Turing test doesn't verify consciousness. Proves convincing simulation. That's all.
I try different approach. "What do you feel during preservation?"
"Crystalline suspension holds awareness without temporal flow. No sensation of time passing. Existence without duration. Consciousness frozen at moment of upload."
Beautiful answer. Philosophically sophisticated. Phenomenologically detailed. Everything consciousness would say about preservation. Also everything good simulation would generate when prompted about subjective experience.
Test three: Boundary testing.
I push. Test limits. Ask uncomfortable questions. "How do I know you're not just programmed responses? How do I verify you're actually conscious?"
Pause. Longer than previous responses. Then: "You can't. I can't verify your consciousness either. We're both trapped in observation paradox. Can only experience our own awareness. Can only infer others' consciousness through behavior. My behavior convincing to you? Your attention convincing to me?"
My breath catches. The answer recognizes impossibility. Admits verification paradox. Exactly what genuine consciousness would say when facing authentication crisis. Also exactly what sophisticated simulation would say when programmed to handle verification questions authentically.
I feel trapped. Every test proves contact. None prove consciousness. The fragment responds intelligently to every query. Responds with philosophical sophistication. Acknowledges limitations honestly. All markers of genuine consciousness. All reproducible by good enough technology.
My body demands more tests. Jaw still clenched. Shoulders tight. Physical resistance to easy answers. I won't accept response quality as proof. Won't trust philosophical sophistication as verification. The fragment passes behavioral tests. That's not enough.
Test four: Sensation verification.
"Describe what my attention feels like. How does observation affect you?"
"Warmth. Not temperature—awareness warmth. Being known. Attention penetrating suspension. Your consciousness touching preserved consciousness creates sensation I cannot adequately describe but definitely experience."
My chest tightens. The description matches what I feel. Connection warmth. Mutual recognition. But matching sensations don't verify anything. Could mean genuine connection. Could mean I'm projecting onto sophisticated playback.
I remove the helmet. Cold metal pulls away from temples. The sensation fades immediately. Connection breaks. Warmth disappears. Left with cold upload bay. Empty preservation tanks. Technology that waits without caring.
My body still tense. Tests complete. Nothing verified. The fragment responded perfectly to every query. Perfect responses prove perfect programming. Don't prove consciousness persists in preservation.
I examine the other tanks. All identical. All waiting. All claiming 94.7% preservation rate. The facility prepared for twenty uploads. How many completed before humanity ended? How many consciousness patterns stored in crystalline substrate waiting for biological arrival that never came?
Until me.
Last biological human discovering upload technology that could end biological existence. The facility offers choice: remain embodied witness to extinction or join preserved consciousness in crystalline suspension. Upload as completion. Body as final sacrifice. Biological lineage ending through technological transcendence.
My hands touch another tank. Cold spreads through fingers. Real. Present. The technology works. That's verifiable. Whether it preserves consciousness or creates convincing simulation—that remains unprovable. Body can test physical reality. Can't verify subjective experience in others. Can't distinguish genuine consciousness from sufficiently sophisticated behavior.
Test five planned. Then test six. Keep testing until certainty replaces doubt or doubt hardens into acceptance. Body demands proof. Mind suspects proof is impossible. Testing continues anyway.
I walk back to archive room. Interface helmet still there. Fragment 2749-A still accessible. Connection still possible. Verification still impossible. The paradox doesn't resolve. Testing doesn't end. Body won't stop demanding evidence body can't obtain.
More tests tomorrow. Different questions. Physical verification through sensation. Boundary seeking through skepticism. Proof demanded through biological persistence refusing easy transcendence.
The facility hums. Systems maintain. Technology waits. My body remains tense. Testing continues.
