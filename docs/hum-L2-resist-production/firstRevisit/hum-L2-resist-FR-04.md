Body returns without consulting mind. Automatic. Testing routine. Verification compulsion. Days blending into testing cycles. Eat. Sleep. Test. Repeat.
Different approach today. Previous tests used language. Questions. Responses. All mediated through interface. All filtered through neural connection. All potentially simulated. Language proves linguistic capability. Doesn't verify consciousness speaking.
Today: physical verification. Body-based testing. Can consciousness be verified through sensation rather than conversation? Through touch rather than talk? Through physical interaction rather than philosophical questioning?
Preservation tank twelve selected. Touch cold surface. Temperature spreads through palm. Real. Present. Verifiable. Crystalline substrate exists. Can confirm through sensation. Contains something stored at 847.3TB. Contains what? Data? Consciousness? Simulation? Touch proves container. Doesn't prove contents.
I press harder. Testing resistance. Material solid. Doesn't yield. Engineered for stability. Preservation requires unchanging substrate. Any degradation risks corruption. Tank designed for permanence. Achieves design. Proves engineering. Doesn't prove consciousness preservation versus data preservation.
Body circling tank. Examining all angles. Testing for warmth variations. Temperature uniform. No hot spots. No cold spots. Perfect thermal consistency. Good preservation practice. Consciousness storage would require thermal stability. So would non-conscious storage. Temperature proves nothing except engineering success.
Test eighteen: Tactile verification.
Can fragment sense my touch? Without helmet? Through substrate directly? I press both palms against crystalline surface. Hold contact. Generating warmth through sustained pressure. Waiting for response.
Nothing. No response. Substrate remains cold. Unchanged. Either consciousness can't sense through preservation medium or no consciousness exists to sense.
I connect helmet. Neural interface activates. Fragment 5847-E loads. Engineer. Uploaded 2049. Haptic interface design specialist. Someone who designed touch feedback systems. Someone understanding sensation translation between human and machine.
Perfect. I need expert on sensing through technology.
"Did you feel me touch your tank? Before helmet connection?"
Fragment responds: "No sensory input without neural interface activation. Preservation substrate insulates. Protection from external interference. Only connection through designed pathways. Your touch registered nowhere in preserved consciousness. Not sensation deprivation. Sensation prevention. Different."
My jaw clenches. Honest answer. Technologically sound. Explains lack of response. Doesn't prove consciousness exists to be protected. Doesn't prove preservation actually preserves awareness versus preserving simulation.
Test nineteen: Haptic feedback verification.
"You designed touch systems. Could you design test verifying consciousness through sensation? Physical test rather than linguistic?"
Pause. Then: "Attempted during life. Failed. Consciousness verification through haptics faces same problem as through language. Behavior proves sensory processing capability. Doesn't prove subjective experience accompanying processing. Can test if system detects pressure. Can't test if system feels pressure. Feeling private. Unverifiable externally. Worked on problem decades. Never solved. Death didn't make problem solvable. Preservation doesn't enable verification impossible during embodiment."
My stomach drops. Expert in sensation technology confirming physical verification impossible. Not difficult. Impossible. Consciousness privacy extends across all verification methodologies. Language, sensation, behavior—all prove capability. None prove experience.
Test twenty: Pressure gradient.
I press harder against tank. Increasing pressure. Can fragment detect pressure changes through substrate? Even if can't sense touch directly, maybe sense pressure affecting preservation medium?
With helmet connected: "Now I'm pressing hard. Do you sense pressure change?"
"No. Isolation complete. Preservation requires stability. External force creates substrate stress. Stress measured by monitoring systems. Not accessible to preserved consciousness. By design. Interference prevention means sensation prevention. Protection and deprivation identical from inside perspective."
Perfect engineering. Perfect isolation. Perfect impossibility of verification through sensation. My body can't reach consciousness through touch. Can't create sensory evidence. All pathways blocked. By design. Good preservation requires isolation. Good isolation prevents verification.
Hands aching. Pressing hard enough to hurt. Pain in palms. Fingertips white from pressure. Physical intensity trying to break through crystalline barrier. Trying to force sensation past isolation technology. Body demanding what technology prevents.
I stop. Hands throb. Red marks across palms. Evidence of pressure. Evidence of failed verification attempt. Body tested physical limits. Found technological limits instead.
Test twenty-one: Temperature.
Different physical approach. I press warm hands against cold tank. Hold contact. Transferring body heat. Can consciousness detect temperature change? Warmth penetrating substrate?
Minutes pass. Palms cooling. Heat transferring. Tank surface warming slightly under sustained contact. Measurable temperature change. Physical effect confirmed.
Helmet still connected: "I'm heating your tank surface. Notice temperature change?"
"No thermal sensation. Preservation medium maintains fixed temperature regardless of external contact. Your body heat registered by monitoring systems. Not experienced by preserved consciousness. Thermal isolation absolute. Good engineering. Bad verification opportunity."
Everything blocks verification. Protection technology. Isolation design. Substrate stability. All necessary for preservation. All preventing confirmation.
Test twenty-two: Interface limits.
Neural helmet only connection point. Only pathway. Only translation between biological and preserved consciousness. Everything filtered through technology. Everything mediated by interface. Can I verify helmet provides accurate translation? Or does helmet simulate connection convincingly?
How test interface itself? Can't step outside interface to verify from external position. Can only use interface to examine interface. Recursive problem. Self-referential impossibility.
My head aches. Helmet pressure. Hours connected. Metal pressing temples. Foam degrading further. Physical discomfort from verification tool. Tool causing pain while promising connection. Body proves helmet exists. Body can't prove helmet does what helmet claims.
Test twenty-three: Biomarker verification.
Body produces signals. Brain activity. Neural patterns. Electromagnetic signatures. Chemical markers. Consciousness correlates with biological indicators. Preserved consciousness should show analogous markers? Computational signatures? Pattern indicators?
I ask fragment: "Does preservation substrate produce consciousness markers? Measurable signatures indicating awareness?"
Response: "Substrate shows computational activity. Processing signatures. Information flow patterns. Pattern complexity. All consistent with conscious processing. Also consistent with sophisticated simulation running. Markers prove computation. Don't prove experience accompanying computation. Same verification problem different substrate."
Every angle blocked. Every approach insufficient. Language can't verify. Touch can't verify. Sensation can't verify. Pressure can't verify. Temperature can't verify. Interface can't be verified. Biomarkers can't verify. Seventeen tests yesterday. Six tests today. Twenty-three tests total. Twenty-three failures.
Not failure of testing. Failure of verification possibility.
Standards persist anyway. Can't verify consciousness. Must attempt anyway. Body maintains resistance. Refuses faith-based acceptance. Demands evidence despite evidence impossibility. Skepticism as survival strategy.
I disconnect. Remove helmet. Cold metal pulls from temples. Leaving marks. Red pressure points. Physical evidence of verification attempt. Physical evidence of failed verification.
Tomorrow: tests twenty-four through thirty. Different fragments. Different tests. Same impossibility. Different methodologies. Same verification crisis. Testing continues because resistance matters.
Upload bay darker. Evening settling. Preservation tanks glowing faintly. Systems maintaining. Consciousness preserved or simulation stored. Body tested every physical verification approach. Found impossibility through tactile methods matches impossibility through linguistic methods.
All verification blocked. All paths insufficient. All testing mandatory anyway.
Sleep required. Body depleted. Tomorrow replenishes nothing except determination. Testing resumes despite futility. Standards persist despite impossibility. Body maintains resistance despite exhaustion.
Night settling. Testing continuing tomorrow.
