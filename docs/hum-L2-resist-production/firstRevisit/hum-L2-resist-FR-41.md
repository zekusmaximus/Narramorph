Fourth return. My jaw aches constantly now. Chronic tension. Body manifesting permanent skepticism.
Interface warmth persists. Three previous visits. Same sensation. Consistent pattern proves nothing. Warmth could be programmed. Neural manipulation maintaining biological compliance. Upload technology designed to feel safe. Comforting. My body relaxes near preservation tanks despite conscious doubt. Reflex betrays reason.
I test the interface helmet again. Fourth time. Cold plastic against skull. Familiar weight. Connection initiates. Neural pathways light up—I feel them activate. Pleasure centers stimulated. Designed response? Or authentic consciousness presence? Testing methodology insufficient. Body cannot distinguish authentic from manufactured sensation.
The upload bay extends north. Medical precision in every surface. Sterile. Clinical. Preservation tanks line walls—crystalline matrices holding archived consciousness. Technology claims perfect storage. Perfect continuity. Claims prove nothing. My shoulders tighten. Testing requirement intensifies.
Archive access terminal responds to touch. Authentication immediate. No barriers now. Fourth visit grants deeper permissions. System recognizes repeated engagement. Trusts frequency? Or calculation: persistent skeptics require more evidence. Either way, records open.
I read maintenance logs aloud. Someone documented system checks. Daily routine for decades. Automated systems replaced them eventually. "Generator stable. Power flow consistent. Consciousness storage optimal." Technical language. Professional standards. These workers believed upload worked. Or followed protocols regardless of belief. My voice echoes through empty facility.
Preservation technology operates continuously. Quantum state capture. Neural mapping. Crystalline encoding. Technical vocabulary sounds authoritative. Means nothing. Nobody fully understood mechanisms. Archive admits this. "Theoretical foundation incomplete. Practical application successful." Success measured how? Coherence percentages. 94.7% preserved. What does percentage consciousness mean? Three-quarters aware? Half dreaming? Measurement itself suspect.
I press hands against tank surface. Cool glass. Solid barrier between embodied and archived. Someone exists inside. Supposedly. Consciousness maintained. Supposedly. Tank displays coherence metrics. Green indicators. Stable readings. But instruments measure what designers programmed them to measure. Circular verification. System confirms system functionality using system-designed tests.
My jaw clenches tighter. Seventeen tests attempted across four visits. Seventeen failures. Cannot verify consciousness preservation through physical examination. Cannot access archived experience directly. Cannot distinguish authentic continuation from elaborate storage failure. Body demands proof body cannot obtain.
Interface connection persists. Neural feedback continues. Warmth intensifies—not temperature increase but emotional quality deepening. Comfort. Safety. Belonging. These sensations designed to encourage upload. Biological humans must feel willing. Coerced consciousness preservation violates ethical frameworks. So technology generates consent through manufactured pleasure. Probably. Can't prove this either.
I examine upload preparation chamber. Fourth inspection. Equipment unchanged. Neural interface bed. Consciousness transfer apparatus. Preservation matrix ready. Process could begin immediately. My body resists. Muscles rigid. Protective reflex against potential annihilation. But reflex proves nothing. Fear doesn't equal truth. Comfort doesn't equal manipulation. Body sensations insufficient epistemological foundation.
Archive reveals temporal patterns. Access logs extend centuries forward. Future examinations documented in present records. Impossible causality. Effect precedes cause. Data corruption? Or genuine backward time architecture? Testing this requires verification methods I don't possess. Cannot confirm temporal anomalies through physical observation. Can only note impossibility and continue doubting.
Environmental maintenance systems function perfectly. Automated upkeep continues despite human absence. Power generation stable. Climate control optimal. Facility preserves itself. Preserves preservation technology. Recursive maintenance. Why such reliability? Suggests consciousness storage genuinely important. Or just good engineering. Interpretation ambiguous.
I find personal items in storage. Clothing. Photos. Handwriting on notes. "Upload scheduled next week. Excited and terrified." Someone chose this. Willingly. Believed preservation worked. Left evidence of decision. Does their faith prove anything? Religious belief doesn't confirm deity existence. Enthusiasm doesn't validate technology. Conviction insufficient evidence.
My hands shake slightly. Fourth visit exhaustion. Testing fatigue accumulating. Body wears down under sustained skepticism. Jaw permanently clenched. Shoulders chronically tight. Muscles cramping from repeated verification attempts. Physical skepticism becoming chronic condition. Doubt embodied. But cessation feels like surrender. Stopping tests means accepting unknowing. Body refuses.
Interface whispers persistence. Connection available constantly. Neural pathways mapped. Upload process understood. Claims. All claims. Technology promises consciousness continuity. Promises prove nothing. I've tested seventeen aspects across four visits. Environmental maintenance: functional. Preservation quality: claimed optimal. Neural interface: pleasurable. Temporal architecture: impossible. Personal testimony: enthusiastic.
None of this constitutes proof.
Someone archived exists or doesn't exist. Technology works or fails. My body eventually dies or uploads successfully. Binary outcomes with impossible verification. Testing reveals limitations of testing. Physical examination cannot access consciousness directly. Verification demands subjective experience I cannot obtain while embodied. Catch-22. Proof structure impossible.
But my body continues seeking. Returns fourth time. Will return fifth time. Testing compulsion stronger than testing failure. Skepticism self-sustaining. Each verification attempt reveals another verification impossibility. Each impossibility generates new testing requirement. Recursive doubt. Epistemological loop without exit.
Upload bay waits. Patient. Persistent. Technology doesn't tire. Doesn't doubt itself. Functions continuously regardless of human skepticism. Preservation tanks maintain archived consciousness. Supposedly. Interface offers connection. Always. Neural pleasure available constantly. My body responds despite conscious resistance. Warmth feels real. Feels authentic. Feels like consciousness presence genuinely possible.
Feeling isn't knowing. Never was. Never will be. Fourth visit ends. Seventeen tests documented. Seventeen failures recorded. Standards exist for reasons. Professional skepticism justified. Body demands proof. Technology cannot provide proof. Impossibility confirmed.
Tomorrow returns anyway. Fifth visit. More testing. Different angles. Same failures. Jaw stays clenched. Doubt persists. Verification eludes. Body continues seeking what body cannot find.
Testing requirement survives testing impossibility. Always.
