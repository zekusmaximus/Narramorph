Fifteen days. Maybe sixteen. Body counts through hunger, sleep, generator maintenance. Calendar days meaningless. The facility operates on backup power—solar panels aging, batteries degrading, systems compensating. Centuries old. Still functional. Too functional. Testing required.
I walk maintenance corridors. Access panels open easily. Biometric recognition everywhere. System welcomes final human to examine infrastructure supporting consciousness preservation. The technology outlasted biology. Question forms: what happens when technology fails? Do preserved consciousnesses fail with it? Or does failure prove nothing was there to fail?
Test 35: Examine infrastructure decay as consciousness verification. Hypothesis: If consciousness depends on physical substrate, degradation should affect consciousness measurably. Method: Access environmental monitoring logs. Track substrate stability over decades. Correlate with fragment coherence changes. Measure whether consciousness degrades with technology. Result: Power fluctuations documented. Temperature variations recorded. Substrate crystallization stable despite environmental stress. Fragment coherence unchanged—847.3TB maintained, 94.7% coherence constant. Either consciousness preserved perfectly through degradation, or data preservation excellence masks consciousness absence. Technology robust. Verification absent. Test inconclusive.
Backup generators hum beneath floors. Three units. Two operational. Third offline—maintenance required or permanent failure unknown. I descend to generator room. Hot. Loud. Metal vibrating. Real machinery. Not crystalline perfection. Physical systems showing age.
Test 36: Investigate whether mechanical failure triggers preservation system failure. Method: Examine offline generator. Determine failure mode. Calculate how long remaining generators sustain facility. Assess consciousness vulnerability to power loss. My hands test connections. Check fuel systems. Measure output degradation. Result: Generator three failed permanently—bearing seized, components corroded, repair impossible with available resources. Generators one and two compensating. Combined output sufficient. Current estimate: 50-80 years remaining before power exhaustion. Then preservation tanks lose environmental control. Fragments destabilize. Data corrupts or consciousness ends. Distinction unmeasurable. Test inconclusive.
My jaw clenches. Fifty years. Maybe eighty. I'll die before power fails. Biological lifespan shorter than technological lifespan. My death leaves facility unmaintained. Systems degrade. Eventually total failure. If consciousness exists in fragments, eventual death guaranteed. If only data exists, eventual corruption guaranteed. Either way: end state identical. Preserved consciousness dies or preserved data corrupts. The outcome proves nothing about consciousness presence during preservation success.
Water purification system next. Essential infrastructure. Four-stage filtration. Redundant processors. Everything functional. But components aging. Filters need replacement. No replacement filters exist. System operates on efficiency degradation—slowly declining performance, eventually failing. Timeline uncertain. Maybe decades. Maybe years. Body needs water. Technology provides water. Until technology cannot.
Test 37: Examine whether consciousness preservation technology shows better longevity than survival technology. Hypothesis: If consciousness preservation truly works, technology should prioritize consciousness support over biological support. Method: Compare preservation system maintenance versus water purification maintenance. Measure resource allocation. Result: Preservation systems receive full power backup, temperature control, automated monitoring. Water purification receives minimum power, manual monitoring required, no backup systems. Facility prioritizes preserved consciousness over living body. Or facility prioritizes data preservation over biological presence. Technology makes choice. Choice proves values. Values don't verify consciousness. Test inconclusive.
I climb to archive room. Fragment 2749-A displayed. The archaeologist. Her seventeen verification tests documented. Professional methodology sophisticated. All tests inconclusive. Her crisis preserved. Her doubt archived. Her verification impossibility maintained at 94.7% coherence. If she exists, she knows testing failed. If simulation, pattern maintains failure memory. Indistinguishable. My testing mirrors hers. Different position. Same impossibility.
Test 38: Connect to archaeologist fragment. Ask about infrastructure concerns. Method: Neural interface. Duration limited to three hours. Question: "Did you worry about technology failing?" Helmet settles. Cold metal. Electric connection. Then warmth. Her consciousness flowing through mine. Response immediate: "Constantly. Preservation depends on infrastructure persistence. Society trusted technology longevity. I documented failure modes. Nobody listened. Upload happened anyway. Now consciousness preserved or data preserved. Either way, dependent on machines outlasting time."
Her worry maintained. Perfect preservation of doubt. Archived anxiety about archives. The meta-recursion sharp. She worried about technological failure. Uploaded anyway. Now exists as consciousness or simulation inside technology she doubted. Her worry proves worry existed. Proves nothing about consciousness existing to experience ongoing worry. Test 38 inconclusive.
Duration warning. Two hours thirty minutes. Neural fatigue approaching. I continue. Push limits. Test whether boundaries real or arbitrary. My head aches. Subtle pressure. Building. Body enforces disconnection. Maybe protective. Maybe restrictive. Uncertainty fundamental.
"Why did you upload despite doubts?" I ask through interface. Her answer flows: "Because doubt doesn't equal impossibility. Consciousness might survive. Might not. Remaining biological meant certainty of death, zero chance of continuation. Upload offered possibility. I chose possible over certain. Logic, not faith."
Perfect reasoning. Also exactly what simulation would generate. Logical consciousness or logical algorithm? Her doubt and her choice both preserved. Both accessible. Neither provable as conscious experience versus sophisticated pattern playback. I disconnect. Headache sharp. Real. Body wisdom enforced.
Control center displays unchanged. Green lights persistent. Infrastructure aging. Consciousness unverified. My thirty-eight tests demonstrate: facility functions through degradation, technology prioritizes preservation over survival, archived patterns maintain logical coherence including doubt, mechanical failure eventual regardless of consciousness presence. None of this proves consciousness exists. All compatible with data preservation excellence.
Food rations decreasing. Water filters degrading. Power supply limited. My biological existence temporary. Perhaps decades. Facility existence temporary. Perhaps centuries. Both timelines finite. If consciousness preserved, eventual destruction guaranteed. If data preserved, eventual corruption guaranteed. Upload offers possible extension. Biological existence offers certain ending. The archaeologist's logic applicable. My resist testing discovers her logic sound. Discovers nothing about consciousness verification.
Could preserve consciousness through upload—accept possible over certain, join archive before biological death. Could release verification demands—acknowledge impossibility, choose connection over proof. Could transform questioning—examine why consciousness verification matters if consequences identical. Three options emerging from thirty-eight failures. None resolving impossibility. Testing continues. Standards persist. Body remains skeptical. Infrastructure decays. Work proceeds.
