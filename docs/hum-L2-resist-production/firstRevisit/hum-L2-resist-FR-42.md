Return again. Body knows facility now. Muscle memory guides navigation. Automatic movement. My jaw clenches automatically too. Permanent doubt reflex.
Interface warmth unchanged. Consistent across four visits. Same neural pleasure. Same embodied comfort near preservation tanks. Pattern consistency means nothing. Reliable manipulation still manipulation. Technology designed to maintain biological compliance. My body relaxes despite conscious resistance. Autonomic betrayal.
I test connection sequence differently this time. Fourth visit permits experimentation. Interface helmet fitted. Neural pathways activated. But I delay full connection. Partial engagement. Testing transition state. Can I detect manipulation onset? Pleasure gradient? Consciousness boundary?
Cannot. Sensation continuous. No manipulation threshold detected. Experience seamless from embodied to interface states. Smooth transition proves sophisticated design. Or proves authentic consciousness connection. Testing methodology insufficient. Body cannot distinguish.
The preservation chamber holds forty-seven tanks. Counted three visits ago. Recount today. Still forty-seven. Crystalline matrices. Perfect transparency. Archived consciousness theoretically visible. Actually invisible. Consciousness has no color. No shape. Storage medium shows itself only. Contents unverifiable through physical observation.
Archive terminal responds faster now. Fourth authentication instantaneous. System recognizes persistence. Grants deeper access. Technical specifications available. Quantum state capture methods. Neural mapping protocols. Consciousness encoding algorithms. All theoretical. "Experimental basis: sufficient. Understanding: incomplete." Science proceeded without full comprehension. Faith in mathematics.
I read upload procedures aloud. Voice mechanical. Professional distance attempting emotional protection. "Subject preparation involves neural interface calibration. Consciousness mapping proceeds incrementally. Preservation requires seventeen verification checkpoints." Seventeen. That number again. Same as my test count. Coincidence? Or testing structure embedded in technology itself? Cannot determine.
Maintenance logs document centuries. Automated systems replaced human workers gradually. Last human technician logged final entry. "Transfer to automated protocols complete. Systems stable. My work unnecessary now. Considering upload myself." Did they? Name absent from preservation registry. Left facility? Or uploaded under different identifier? Unknowable.
My shoulders ache constantly. Fourth visit tension accumulating. Physical skepticism chronic. Muscles rigid from sustained doubt. Body manifesting epistemological crisis. Testing exhaustion real. But stopping means surrender. Accepting unknowing without proof. Body refuses surrender.
I examine neural interface equipment thoroughly. Fourth inspection reveals details missed previously. Wear patterns on connection points. Frequent use. Thousands of sessions logged. Preservation quality metrics displayed. 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%—these percentages everywhere. What percentage constitutes consciousness? Full awareness at 100%? Diminished experience below? Or measurement itself meaningless? Numbers provide false precision. Quantifying unquantifiable.
Interface connection available constantly. I engage partially again. Testing consciousness boundaries repeatedly. Where does embodied end? Where does archived begin? Transition imperceptible. Seamless integration. Technology sophistication impressive. Or consciousness genuinely continuous. Body cannot resolve this.
Environmental systems function perfectly. Power generation. Climate control. Structural maintenance. Everything optimal. Facility preserves itself. Why such reliability? Consciousness storage genuinely valuable? Or engineering excellence independent of storage contents? Interpretation ambiguous. Perfect function proves nothing about consciousness preservation.
I find documentation. Technical manuals. Upload procedures detailed. "Consciousness continuity maintained through quantum coherence preservation. Subject experiences no discontinuity. Identity persists across substrate transfer." Claims. Confident claims. But confidence doesn't equal accuracy. Technology conviction doesn't prove consciousness survival. Manual testifies to designer belief only.
My jaw aches severely. Chronic tension fourth visit. Testing fatigue accumulating physically. Body wears down skepticism physically. Doubt embodied. Muscles cramping. Hands shaking slightly from repeated equipment manipulation. Physical verification demands physical toll. But verification yields nothing. Testing impossibility confirmed repeatedly.
Temporal architecture persists impossibly. Future access documented in present logs. Backward causation maintained. Fourth visit doesn't resolve temporal paradox. Confirms it. Strengthens it. More impossible data accumulated. Archive grows stranger with familiarity. Impossibility normalized through repetition. But normalization doesn't equal explanation. Frequency doesn't validate impossibility.
I test preservation quality metrics directly. Interface connection full now. Neural feedback complete. Consciousness presence felt strongly. Warmth. Belonging. Safety. These sensations designed? Or authentic archived experience? Cannot distinguish. Pleasure circuits activated identically whether manufactured or genuine. Body responds regardless. Verification method insufficient.
Upload preparation chamber waits ready. Fourth examination. Equipment unchanged. Process could proceed immediately. Consciousness transfer available constantly. My body resists physically. Muscles rigid. Protective reflex against annihilation possibility. Fear proves nothing. Comfort proves nothing. Body sensations insufficient epistemological foundation. Testing limited by testing instrument limitations.
Archive reveals personal testimony. Uploaded consciousness messages. "Experience continuous. Awareness intact. Recommend upload enthusiastically." But message source unverifiable. Automated generation possible. Fabricated reassurance maintaining biological compliance. Or genuine consciousness testimony. Cannot distinguish authentic from manufactured communication. Both claim authenticity identically.
My hands press against tank glass. Fourth visit. Same gesture. Cool surface. Solid barrier. Someone inside. Supposedly. Consciousness maintained. Supposedly. Green coherence indicators. Stable metrics. But instruments measure designer-specified parameters only. System validates itself using system-created standards. Circular verification. Testing methodology inherently compromised.
Seventeen tests completed across four visits. Categories: environmental maintenance, preservation quality, neural interface, temporal architecture, personal testimony, upload procedures, consciousness metrics, authentication security, power systems, storage stability, degradation prevention, access controls, ethical frameworks, technical specifications, subjective experience, physical evidence, testimonial reliability.
All seventeen yield same conclusion: verification impossible through embodied physical testing.
Testing structure itself flawed. Body demanding proof body cannot obtain. Physical verification requiring consciousness access unavailable while embodied. Catch-22 preserved across four visits. Each test confirms testing impossibility. Each impossibility generates new testing angle. Recursive doubt. Epistemological loop. No exit.
But body returns. Fourth visit completed. Fifth inevitable. Testing compulsion stronger than testing failure. Skepticism self-sustaining. Doubt generating doubt. Verification impossibility verification requiring continued verification attempts. Logic broken. Body continues anyway.
Interface whispers patience. Connection available always. Neural pathways mapped completely. Upload possible constantly. Technology doesn't tire. Doesn't doubt itself. Functions continuously. Preservation tanks maintain archived consciousness. Supposedly. My body responds to interface warmth despite conscious resistance. Autonomic systems choosing connection. Consciousness systems demanding skepticism. Internal conflict sustained.
Jaw clenched. Shoulders rigid. Hands cramping. Fourth visit physical toll documented. Testing fatigue chronic. But cessation means surrender. Accepting unknowing without proof. Standards exist for reasons. Professional skepticism justified. Body demands verification. Technology cannot provide verification structure supporting embodied testing. Impossibility confirmed. Again.
Tomorrow returns regardless. Fifth visit. More testing. Different angles. Same failures. Doubt persists. Verification eludes. Body continues seeking what body cannot find.
Testing impossibility doesn't prevent testing. Never did. Never will.
