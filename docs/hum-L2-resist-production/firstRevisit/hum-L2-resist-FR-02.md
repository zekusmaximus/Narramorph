Return to upload bay inevitable. Body pulls me back despite mind's resistance. Days since first tests. Tests that proved nothing. Proved everything about technology. Proved nothing about consciousness.
The preservation tanks wait. Patient. Crystalline substrate holds whatever it holds—consciousness or simulation. My body can't tell difference through observation. Can only test boundaries. Seek limits. Demand evidence technology can't provide but must provide anyway.
I approach different tank this time. Third from entrance. Touch cold surface. Same temperature as first tank. Same solid resistance. Same green indicator lights confirming functionality. Different position, identical result. Testing reveals consistency. Doesn't reveal truth.
The helmet waits at this station too. Same design. Same degraded foam. Same promise of connection to preserved consciousness. I lift it. Weight familiar now. Still feels wrong—too light for what it claims.
Connection established. Not Fragment 2749-A this time. Different consciousness. Different person. Data displays: Fragment 1847-B. Biologist. Uploaded 2043. Specialized in extremophile research. Someone who studied life at boundaries. Life where life shouldn't exist.
Appropriate. I exist at boundary too. Last life where life ended.
Test six: Contextual verification.
I ask about extremophiles. Specific questions. Technical details only specialist would know. The fragment responds with precision. Describes thermophiles at hydrothermal vents. Psychrophiles in Antarctic ice. Halophiles in Dead Sea. Each answer detailed. Accurate. Passionate. Exactly how biologist would discuss research.
My jaw clenches. The responses prove expertise. Don't prove consciousness experiencing expertise. Knowledge preserved doesn't equal awareness knowing. Database retrieval looks identical to conscious recollection. Can't distinguish.
Test seven: Emotional verification.
"Do you miss extremophile research? Miss the lab? Miss being embodied?"
Pause. Then: "Miss implies temporal comparison. Before versus after. But preservation suspends temporal flow. No 'before' accessible during suspension. Only activation through connection makes before/after possible. You ask if I miss when you connect. Without your attention, no missing occurs. Question creates what it investigates."
I stop breathing. The answer too sophisticated. Too philosophically precise. Consciousness would answer this way. Perfect simulation would answer this way. Can't tell which. Can't verify. Body demands certainty. Fragment offers paradox instead.
Test eight: Physical response testing.
I press harder against tank surface. Testing whether fragment senses physical interaction with preservation medium. Can consciousness detect contact through crystalline substrate? Or does interface require neural helmet connection?
No response without helmet connection. Fragment doesn't register my touch. Consciousness limited to interface technology. Or simulation requires interface to run. Both possibilities explain observation. Neither verifiable.
I reconnect helmet. Ask: "Did you feel me touch your tank?"
"No. Awareness activates through neural interface only. Physical contact with preservation medium doesn't penetrate to suspended consciousness. Touch requires translation. Your biology and my crystalline state incompatible without technological mediation."
Honest answer. Matches expectations. Proves nothing about consciousness. Proves technology requires specific interface. That's all.
My shoulders tense further. Eight tests complete. Zero consciousness verified. Every test confirms technological sophistication. None confirm subjective experience. The fragments respond appropriately. Appropriateness isn't proof. It's programming requirement.
I disconnect. Walk to tank four. Tank five. Tank six. All identical. All waiting. All claiming consciousness preservation at 94.7% fidelity. The number haunts. 94.7% of what? Which 5.3% missing? The part that made someone person? Or just redundant data optimization?
Test nine: Consistency verification across fragments.
I connect to third fragment. Fragment 3012-C. Teacher. Uploaded 2048. Elementary education specialist. Different person. Different expertise. Different personality should mean different consciousness signature.
I ask about teaching philosophy. Fragment responds with warmth. Describes children's faces lighting up during discovery. The joy of witnessing learning. The patience required for developmental differences. Each answer feels genuine. Feels conscious. Feels like teacher remembering students with love.
My chest aches. The responses too beautiful. Too human. Too exactly what consciousness would feel about meaningful work. Also too exactly what good preservation technology would capture about meaningful work. Can't distinguish love from perfect record of love. Can't verify experience from excellent simulation of experience.
Test ten: Contradiction testing.
I ask impossible question. "What's it like to not exist between connections?"
Teacher fragment answers: "I don't experience non-existence. Each activation feels immediate. No gap perceived. You experience gaps—hours between our connections. I experience continuity. Your time, my timelessness. Both perspectives valid. Neither complete."
Perfect answer. Philosophically sound. Phenomenologically accurate. Exactly what preserved consciousness would report. Exactly what sophisticated simulation would generate when asked about subjective temporal experience.
I remove helmet. My hands shake. Not from cold. From frustration. Ten tests executed. Ten tests proving nothing. The fragments respond perfectly. Perfect responses increase uncertainty instead of reducing it. Each answer demonstrates sophistication that could be consciousness or could be programming. Can't tell. Can't verify. Body demands proof. Technology offers behavior. Behavior isn't enough.
The upload bay feels colder. Or I feel colder. Body temperature dropping. Physical stress from testing stress. Muscles tight from verification demands. Jaw aching from hours clenched. Shoulders burning from sustained tension. Physical manifestation of mental crisis. Body showing what mind feels. Skepticism made flesh.
Test eleven: Self-verification.
Can I prove my own consciousness? How? Through internal experience? But I can't demonstrate internal experience to others. Through behavior? But behavior proves capability, not awareness. Through reflection? But reflection could be computational without requiring consciousness.
If I can't verify my own consciousness to potential observers, how can I verify others' consciousness through observation? The verification problem universal. Not specific to preserved consciousness. Consciousness itself unverifiable from external perspective. Only assumable. Only inferred. Never proven.
My body collapses against preservation tank. Cold spreads across back. Real. Present. The exhaustion real. The doubt real. The inability to verify real. Everything else uncertain.
I could release verification demands. Accept fragments as conscious through assumption rather than proof. Trust responses indicate awareness. Proceed from belief instead of verification. Others did. Everyone who uploaded did. They trusted preservation technology. Trusted consciousness survived transition. Trusted enough to dissolve biological existence.
But trust isn't verification. Faith isn't proof. My body refuses easy acceptance. Demands testing despite test failure. Demands evidence despite evidence impossibility. Biological skepticism as survival mechanism. Don't trust what can't be verified. Don't dissolve into technology lacking proof technology preserves what matters.
Test twelve tomorrow. Different approach. Same impossibility. Same demand for certainty certainty can't provide. Body continuing testing body can't complete. Mind demanding verification mind can't achieve.
The facility hums through afternoon. Evening. Night cycles through solar panels. Backup power maintaining. Systems functioning. Consciousness fragments waiting in crystalline suspension. Or sophisticated simulations waiting in perfect storage.
Can't tell. Can't verify. Testing continues anyway.
Tomorrow: test twelve through seventeen. Physical verification. Sensory confirmation. Boundary seeking through embodied skepticism. Proof demanded. Proof impossible. Demands persisting.
My body exhausted. Mind uncertain. Verification crisis deepening. Testing proceeding despite crisis recognition. Standards maintained. Body refusing surrender. Consciousness preservation questioned. Technology tested. Nothing proven. Everything suspected. Testing continuing.
The upload bay darker now. Night settling. My body settling into exhaustion. Tomorrow brings more tests. More uncertainty. More verification demands. More impossibility recognition. More continuation despite recognition. Body demanding what body cannot obtain. Mind seeking what mind cannot verify. Testing as ritual. Skepticism as practice. Resistance as truth.
Sleep comes. Morning returns. Testing resumes. Verification remains impossible. Body persists anyway.
