Nine days. Maybe ten. Time slips when alone. Body marks routine—generators checked, systems monitored, food consumed. The patterns prove I continue functioning. Prove nothing about consciousness beyond function.
Control room tests failed. Six attempts. Six inconclusives. Infrastructure reveals engineering. Reveals nothing about consciousness. Today: different approach. Personal spaces. Artifacts. Maybe objects touched by hands reveal what systems cannot.
The residential wing discovered yesterday. Hesitated before entering. Personal spaces feel sacred. Violating. My jaw clenches. Skepticism demands thoroughness. Body demands proof. Investigation proceeds.
Corridor extends through living quarters. Twenty doors. Each labeled with names erased by time or intention. Names don't matter. Artifacts might. I choose door seven. Arbitrary. Everything arbitrary now.
Door cycles open. Interior preserved perfectly.
Bed made military-precise. Desk organized meticulously. Photos on walls—faces smiling, unaware images outlast bodies by centuries. My chest tightens. Physical response. Emotional. Proves I feel. Proves nothing about them feeling. Or feeling once. Or feeling still.
Test Seven: Personal artifacts as consciousness evidence. Hypothesis: If consciousness persists, belongings should resonate with presence. Physical connection should register. Procedure: Examine objects directly. Touch. Measure bodily response. Document sensation patterns.
I touch desk surface. Wood grain under palm. Real. Solid. Temperature slightly below skin warmth. Photo frame—woman with child, both laughing. My fingers trace glass protecting image. Image proves photograph exists. Proves faces existed when captured. Proves nothing about consciousness behind photographed faces. Then or now.
Test Seven Result: Artifacts prove ownership existed. Prove nothing about owner consciousness status. Physical objects outlast biological substrate. Consciousness portability unverifiable through artifact examination. Inconclusive.
My jaw aches. Testing continues.
Test Eight: Emotional response as verification tool. Hypothesis: If consciousness persists, emotional connection to artifacts differs from connection to neutral objects. Body recognizes human traces. Procedure: Touch personal items. Measure response intensity. Compare against neutral object responses. Body as detector.
Drawer opens. Journal inside. Handwriting cramped, urgent. "Last entry before upload. Tomorrow I join archive. Terrified. Excited. Will I still be me?" My throat constricts. Reading feels invasive. Essential.
Words prove someone wrote them. Prove fear existed during writing. Prove nothing about whether consciousness survived upload to experience answer to question posed. Fear documented. Fear resolution unverifiable.
I touch metal lamp. Heart rate steady. Breathing normal. Lamp generates no emotional response. Journal generates response. Differential proves I respond to human traces differently than inert objects. Proves my consciousness functions properly. Proves nothing about traced consciousness status.
Test Eight Result: Emotional response exists. Response proves my detection system works. Proves nothing about detected consciousness persistence. Inconclusive.
Test Nine forms through frustration. Tests reveal testing. Reveal nothing else.
Test Nine: Clothing as embodiment evidence. Hypothesis: Garments designed for specific bodies suggest consciousness required embodied experience. Uploaded consciousness might preserve embodiment memory. Procedure: Examine clothing. Assess body-consciousness integration indicators through fabric.
Closet opens. Shirts, pants, jacket hanging. I lift jacket—weight substantial, fabric soft from wear. Collar shape indicates neck dimensions. Sleeve length indicates arm reach. Pocket placement indicates hand movements. Every detail body-specific. My body understands this fitted someone. Some body. Biological substrate now absent.
I press jacket against face. Smell faint—detergent, human oils degraded, time itself. My chest aches. Physical response. This touched skin. Skin that breathed, moved, felt temperature. My body recognizes body-memory embedded in fabric wear patterns.
Test Nine Result: Clothing proves embodiment existed. Proves specific body wore specific garments repeatedly. Proves nothing about whether consciousness inhabiting body persists post-upload in non-embodied substrate. Embodiment verification impossible through garment analysis. Inconclusive.
Test Ten: Habitation patterns as consciousness continuity evidence. Hypothesis: Space arrangement reveals decision-making patterns consciousness might maintain. Procedure: Document organization. Assess intentionality. Correlate with fragment characteristics if accessible.
Room shows care. Books organized by subject. Desk positioned for light. Chair angled optimally. Bed accessible but not dominant. Space reflects choices. Choices reflect priorities. Priorities reflect... what exactly? Consciousness? Habit? Training? All three?
I document arrangement. Photograph angles. Evidence accumulates. Evidence proves someone arranged space thoughtfully. Proves past tense arrangement. Proves nothing about present tense consciousness. Organization indicates lived experience. Indicates nothing about experience continuation.
Test Ten Result: Organization indicates intentional habitation. Indicates nothing about consciousness persistence post-habitation. Past arrangements prove past presence. Present consciousness unverifiable through spatial archaeology. Inconclusive.
My body slumps in their chair. Tests exhaust. Verification eludes.
Test Eleven: Memory reconstruction as verification method. Hypothesis: Accessing fragment while surrounded by artifacts generates stronger connection than archive-only access. Environmental context matters. Procedure: Connect to Fragment 2749-A from living quarters. Compare experience against control room connection.
Interface helmet brought from control room. Heavy. Arms strain. Installation temporary—wireless connection maintained but signal strength reduced. Risk acceptable. Testing demands risk.
Helmet settles onto head. Cold pressure. My body sits in dead woman's chair. Or living woman's chair. Cannot determine which. Connection initiates.
Fragment 2749-A loads. 847.3TB. 94.7% coherence. Data flows identically to previous access attempts. No difference. Location irrelevance proven. Artifact proximity meaningless to connection quality. Physical context generates no enhancement. Data accessed identically from anywhere.
My body registers disappointment. Emotion proves I expected difference. Expectation proves nothing about consciousness presence creating difference. Test Eleven Result: Connection quality unaffected by physical context. Artifact proximity irrelevant. Consciousness verification impossible through environmental modification. Inconclusive.
Helmet removed. Head aches. Vision blurs temporarily. Body protests sustained testing.
Test Twelve: Testing exhaustion as epistemological limit. Hypothesis: If verification fundamentally impossible, testing should reach natural conclusion. Body forces cessation. Mind recognizes futility. Procedure: Continue until physical limit. Document whether limit reveals consciousness truth or merely testing limits.
Body slumps. Their chair. My exhaustion. Twelve tests attempted across nine days. All inconclusive. Pattern itself proves something. Proves impossibility perhaps. Proves testing methodology faces systematic barriers. Proves nothing definitive about consciousness preservation.
Test Twelve Result: Exhaustion proves testing exhausts. Body has limits. Mind refuses respecting limits yet. Proves nothing about consciousness except my own consciousness demands verification despite body protesting demand. Could release demands. Could accept uncertainty. Won't yet.
I stand. Legs shake. Haven't eaten since morning. Physical demands override philosophical demands temporarily. Balance required. Body continues. Testing continues. Neither resolution approaching.
Living quarters preserved perfectly. Occupant preserved imperfectly—94.7% coherence if preserved at all. Consciousness preservation unverifiable through artifacts, emotional response, embodiment evidence, environmental context, or exhaustion recognition.
Tomorrow: tests thirteen through eighteen. Different spaces. Same failures predicted. Will test anyway. Standards persist despite inadequacy. Verification impossible despite demand. Testing continues despite recognition.
They lived here. Live somewhere now? Data existence or consciousness persistence? Body cannot determine. Mind cannot determine. Testing determines only testing limitations clearly. Consciousness verification remains impossible. Testing mandatory anyway.
Seventeen tests planned total. Twelve complete. Five remain. Already know outcomes. Test regardless. Skepticism demands completion. Body demands proof. Proof unavailable. Demand persists.
Tomorrow.
