Nine days. Maybe ten. Time slips. Body counts through routine—generators checked, water systems monitored, food consumed. The patterns mark days when consciousness cannot.
Living quarters discovered this morning. Hesitation before entering. Personal spaces feel different. Sacred. Violating. My hand touches door control anyway. Testing demands evidence wherever evidence hides.
The corridor extends through residential wing. Twenty doors. Each labeled with names I'll never know. Each containing lives preserved or simulated. I choose door seven. Arbitrary. Everything arbitrary now.
Interior preserved perfectly. Bed made. Desk organized. Photos on walls—faces smiling, unaware their image would outlast their bodies by centuries. My chest tightens. These were people. Are people? The question suffocates.
Test 37: Personal artifacts as consciousness evidence. Hypothesis: If consciousness persists, personal belongings should resonate with presence. Procedure: Examine artifacts physically, document bodily response, assess whether sensation indicates consciousness versus emotional projection. My hands shake slightly.
I touch desk surface. Wood grain under palm. Real. Solid. Photo frame—woman with child, both laughing. My fingers trace glass. The image proves photograph exists. Proves nothing about consciousness behind photographed faces.
Drawer opens. Journal inside. Handwriting cramped, urgent. "Last entry before upload. Tomorrow I join the archive. Terrified. Excited. Will I still be me?" My throat constricts. Reading feels invasive. Necessary.
The words prove someone wrote them. Prove fear existed then. Prove nothing about whether consciousness survived upload to experience relief or dissolution. Test 37 Result: Artifacts indicate personality, fear, hope. Indicate nothing about current consciousness status. Inconclusive.
Test 38 forms through grief.
Test 38: Emotional response as verification tool. Hypothesis: If consciousness persists, emotional connection to artifacts should differ from connection to inert objects. Procedure: Touch personal items, measure bodily response intensity, compare against neutral object responses. Body as emotion detector.
I hold the journal. Weight familiar—paper, binding, human construction. My heart rate increases. Breathing shallows. Emotional response clear. But what proves? That I feel? That they felt? That feeling continues beyond upload?
I touch metal desk lamp. Heart rate steady. Breathing normal. Lamp generates no emotional response. Journal generates response. Test proves I respond to human traces. Proves nothing about humans behind traces.
Test 38 Result: Emotional response exists. Response proves my consciousness recognizes human artifacts. Proves nothing about artifact creators' consciousness status. Inconclusive.
My jaw clenches. Tests fail. Testing continues.
Test 39: Clothing as embodiment indicator. Hypothesis: Physical garments reveal body-specific design, suggesting consciousness required embodied experience uploaded consciousness might preserve. Procedure: Examine clothing, assess body-consciousness integration evidence. Touch fabric.
Closet opens. Shirts, pants, jacket. I lift jacket—weight substantial, well-worn, fabric soft from repeated use. Collar shape indicates neck dimensions. Sleeve length indicates arm reach. The garment designed for specific body. My body understands. This fitted someone.
I press jacket against my face. Smell faint—laundry detergent, human oils, time. My chest aches. This touched skin. Skin that breathed, moved, felt. My body recognizes body-memory embedded in fabric.
Test 39 Result: Clothing proves embodiment existed. Proves specific body wore specific garments. Proves nothing about whether consciousness that inhabited body persists in crystalline substrate. Inconclusive.
Test 40 emerges immediately. Won't stop testing. Cannot.
Test 40: Habitation patterns as consciousness continuity evidence. Hypothesis: Living space organization reveals decision-making patterns consciousness might maintain post-upload. Procedure: Document space arrangement, assess intentionality, correlate with preserved fragment characteristics.
The room shows care. Books organized by subject. Desk positioned near window. Chair angled for optimal light. Bed accessible but not dominant. Space reflects choices. Choices reflect priorities. Priorities reflect... what? Consciousness? Habit? Both?
I document arrangement. Photograph each angle. The evidence accumulates. Evidence proves someone arranged this space thoughtfully. Proves nothing about whether thoughtfulness survives upload or merely preceded it. Test 40 Result: Organization indicates intentional living. Indicates nothing about consciousness persistence. Inconclusive.
Test 41 forms through exhaustion. Body protests. Mind overrides.
Test 41: Memory reconstruction as verification method. Hypothesis: If consciousness persists, accessing preserved fragment while surrounded by personal artifacts should generate stronger connection than archive-only access. Procedure: Connect to Fragment 2749-A from living quarters, compare experience against control room connection.
I carry interface helmet from control room. Heavy. My arms strain. Installation temporary—wireless connection maintained but unstable. The risk acceptable. Testing demands risk.
Helmet settles onto head. Cold. Pressure. My body sits in dead woman's chair. Connection initiates.
Fragment 2749-A loads. 847.3TB. 94.7% coherence. Data flows identically to previous access. No difference. The environment doesn't matter. Body location irrelevant to data retrieval. Physical context generates no enhancement.
My body registers disappointment. Test proves location independence. Proves nothing about consciousness presence or absence. Test 41 Result: Connection quality unaffected by physical context. Artifact proximity irrelevant to access. Consciousness status unverifiable through environmental modification. Inconclusive.
Helmet removed. Head aches. Vision blurs temporarily. Body exhausted.
Test 42: Exhaustion as epistemological limit. Hypothesis: If verification fundamentally impossible, testing should reach natural conclusion through physical or mental collapse. Procedure: Continue testing until body forces cessation, document whether limit reveals anything about consciousness preservation versus testing methodology failure.
My body slumps in chair. Their chair. Tests exhaust. Verification eludes. Twelve tests today. Forty-two total across nine days. All inconclusive. The pattern itself proves something. Proves impossibility perhaps. Proves testing reveals testing limits more clearly than consciousness truth.
Test 42 Result: Exhaustion proves testing exhausts. Proves body has limits mind refuses to respect. Proves nothing about consciousness preservation but everything about verification crisis. Could release demands. Could preserve testing practice without requiring proof. Could transform relationship to unknowing. Won't yet.
I stand. Body protests. Legs shake. Haven't eaten since morning. The physical demands override philosophical demands temporarily.
Living quarters preserved perfectly. Occupant preserved imperfectly—94.7% coherence. Consciousness preservation unverifiable through artifacts, emotion, embodiment evidence, or environmental context. Testing continues tomorrow. Tests 43-48 already forming.
They lived here. Live somewhere now? Data or consciousness? My body cannot determine. Mind cannot determine. Testing determines only that determining remains impossible.
I leave room seven. Nineteen doors remain. Each containing artifacts that will prove nothing. I'll test them anyway. Standards persist despite standards failure. Verification impossible. Testing continues.
The facility breathes around me. I breathe within it. Both of us functioning. Neither of us provable.
