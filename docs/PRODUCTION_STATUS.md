### Key Learnings from FirstRevisit Phase

1. **Voice Consistency:** Maintained 93.9% average across all complexity levels
2. **Path Philosophy:** Each path maintains distinct voice while blending naturally with character content
3. **Mixed Paths:** Tension sustainable without synthesis up to three simultaneous philosophies
4. **Awareness Scaling:** High awareness (51-60%) creates strong frame-consciousness without metaAware crossing
5. **Recursion Depth:** Fourth visit enables investigation of investigation without losing archaeological voice
6. **Dual Integration:** Computational and temporal phenomena can generate each other across time elegantly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: MetaAware Phase
**Target:** 32 variations (MA-01 through MA-40, excluding completed test variations)

**Key Challenges:**
- Direct reader address introduction (61%+ awareness)
- Frame-consciousness becomes frame-engagement
- "You" language integrated naturally
- Temporal positions include reader explicitly
- Archaeological voice maintained despite direct address

**Preparation Required:**
1. Review MetaAware exemplars (MA-37, MA-38 from test batch)
2. Develop MetaAware cluster specifications
3. Define reader address integration patterns
4. Establish metaAware voice guidelines

**Timeline:**
- Week 8: MetaAware Clusters 1-3 (15 variations)
- Week 9: MetaAware Clusters 4-5 (17 variations)
- Week 10: Integration & polish
