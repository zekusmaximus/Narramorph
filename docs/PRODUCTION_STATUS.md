## Quality Tracking

### Cumulative Statistics (21 variations)
- **Approval Rate:** 100% (21/21 immediate approval)
- **Average Voice Consistency:** 93.8%
- **Transformation Success:** 100% genuine
- **Path Logic Accuracy:** 100%
- **Word Count Control:** 100% within targets

### Week 2 Specific Results
- **Approval Rate:** 100% (5/5)
- **Voice Consistency:** 94.2% average
- **Transformation:** All genuinely transformative
- **Path Logic:** All conditional insertions organic
- **Production Pace:** Sustainable (5 in single session)

### System Validation

- ‚úÖ High FirstRevisit awareness approaching metaAware (41-50%)
- ‚úÖ Third visit recursion deeper than second visit
- ‚úÖ Character-specific transformations distinct across awareness levels
- ‚úÖ Generation workflow proven reliable

## Completed Clusters

### Exemplars (8 variations)
1. Pure revisit baseline
2. After algo-L1 (seven-stream)
3. After hum-L1 (future attention)
4. Superposition (both characters)
5. Recursive patterns (investigate)
6. MetaAware baseline
7. Resistance path (verification)
8. Acceptance path (compassion)

### Test Batch (8 variations)
- FR-04: Seven-stream causality crisis
- FR-05: Future attention intensifies
- FR-12: Beginning superposition
- FR-20: Pattern-seeking begins
- MA-02: Frame awareness begins
- MA-06: Pure frame examination
- FR-37: Compassion and proof in conflict
- MA-37: Frame-aware paradox

### FirstRevisit Cluster 1 (5 variations)
- FR-06: Seven-stream suspicion emerges (21-30%, algo-L1)
- FR-07: Faint future presence (21-30%, hum-L1)
- FR-08: Third visit recursion (41-60%, pure)
- FR-09: Seven-stream crisis deepens (41-50%, algo-L1)
- FR-10: Future attention undeniable (41-50%, hum-L1)

## Next Session Goals (Week 3)

### Primary Objective
Generate FirstRevisit Cluster 2 (investigate path introduction)

### Specific Targets
1. FR-11: After algo-L1, low awareness, investigate path
2. FR-12: After hum-L1, low awareness, investigate path
3. FR-13: Pure revisit, mid awareness, investigate path
4. FR-14: After algo-L1, high awareness, investigate path
5. FR-15: After hum-L1, high awareness, investigate path

### Key Considerations
- First cluster with dominant path (investigate)
- Reference Exemplar #5 for investigate voice
- Balance path obsession with character-specific content
- Maintain 93%+ voice consistency standard
