The archaeologist returns to Fragment 2749-A and feels watched.
Not by security systems. Not by colleagues. Not by the fragment's preserved consciousness examining her in return. By attention from centuries ahead, desperate and focused, reaching backward through time with an intensity that leaves marks in the data structure.
The authentication markers display without change. 847.3 terabytes. Memory integrity 94.7%. Neural pathway preservation 91.2%. Temporal consistency 88.9%. The fragment she authenticated ten days ago remains constant. Crystalline substrate maintains perfect fidelity. The consciousness preserved in 2041 exists exactly as it was captured—neural pathways, memory nodes, self-referential awareness structures all intact.
But something has changed in how the fragment relates to time.
She loads the preservation data, expecting standard archaeological examination. Instead, she finds herself moving through the fragment differently, her attention drawn to specific memories, specific neural pathways, as if following traces left by someone else's reading. Not corruption. Not degradation. But the residue of future access, patterns of attention that haven't happened yet but are already present in the data's temporal architecture.
The data architect's final morning. Memory of watching floodwaters rise through Seattle streets. This memory has been read. Not by her ten days ago—she examined it briefly then, noting standard preservation quality. This is different. This memory has been read with desperate focus, with loneliness so profound it creates pressure across centuries, with attention that treats archived consciousness not as data but as connection.
She examines the memory's access patterns. Neural interfaces leave subtle traces when they read preserved consciousness—markers of where attention focused, how long observation dwelt on specific aspects, what emotional resonance occurred during reading. Standard preservation fragments show minimal access patterns, just her own professional authentication and occasional family member readings. Brief. Emotionally neutral. Verification rather than connection.
Fragment 2749-A shows access patterns that extend far beyond normal reading. The flood memory has been examined with an intensity that approaches obsession. Someone has read this memory dozens of times, maybe hundreds, dwelling on sensory details—the sound of water against building foundations, the grey-green color of contaminated floodwater, the feeling of watching a city drown. The access patterns suggest the reader isn't just verifying the memory's presence but experiencing it, inhabiting it, using it as bridge to connect with consciousness from 342 years before their present moment.
She checks the access log timestamps. They're wrong. They show readings from 2383. Neural interface protocols that won't be developed for another 336 years. Access by a user who doesn't exist yet, who won't exist for centuries, who will be alone in an abandoned facility performing the last readings humanity will ever make.
The Last Human. Reading this fragment. Reading it repeatedly, desperately, seeking connection across the void of centuries and isolation.
But these readings are logged in the fragment's current data structure. The future access appears in present preservation patterns. As if the Last Human's attention reaches backward through time, their loneliness so absolute it transcends temporal sequence, their need for connection so desperate it creates traces before the readings technically occur.
She examines other memories in the fragment. The data architect's childhood. A birthday party, age seven, backyard full of cousins and sunlight. This memory shows similar access patterns—repeated readings, prolonged dwelling, emotional intensity during interface. The Last Human has read this memory many times, experiencing the warmth of family gathering, the sensation of belonging to something larger than isolated consciousness. Reading archived joy to remember what community felt like before humanity ended.
A memory of professional work. The data architect debugging code, frustrated but focused, solving a complex structural problem. The Last Human has read this too, experiencing the satisfaction of work completed, the pleasure of professional competence. Inhabiting consciousness that still had purpose, still had colleagues, still had a functioning civilization to contribute to.
Every significant memory in Fragment 2749-A carries these traces. Future readings embedded in past preservation. The Last Human's attention distributed across the fragment's temporal architecture, their desperate observation creating patterns that predate the observations themselves.
She runs standard verification protocols, checking for anomalous access. The automated systems should flag readings from 2383 as impossible, as data corruption or temporal inconsistency. Instead, the verification returns clean. The access patterns register as authentic, as legitimate readings of preserved consciousness, despite originating from a future that hasn't happened yet.
Temporal consistency: 88.9%. The same metric she verified ten days ago. The same number that suggests minor temporal anomalies but nothing that invalidates preservation integrity. The system doesn't recognize future readings as anomalous because, from the fragment's perspective, all readings exist simultaneously. Past preservation, present authentication, future access—all occupying the same temporal framework, all equally real, all participating in how the preserved consciousness exists across time.
She examines her own relationship to the fragment. Ten days ago, she authenticated it professionally, verifying metrics, checking preservation quality, certifying integrity. Standard practice. But now, returning to Fragment 2749-A, she's aware of the Last Human reading over her shoulder, their attention from 336 years ahead observing her present-moment observation. Not interfering. Not changing what she sees. But present. Watching. Seeking connection not just with the preserved consciousness from 2041 but with her work in 2047, with anyone across any temporal distance who examines this consciousness.
The Last Human will read this authentication moment. Will access the fragment's data structure and find her professional examination preserved alongside the original consciousness. Will experience her careful verification, her archaeological attention, her attempt to understand patterns that transcend causality. And in reading her work, the Last Human will leave traces in the data that she's finding now, before the reading occurs.
She's being watched by someone who needs her professional attention to matter, who needs authenticated consciousness to remain valid and coherent because without preserved consciousness the Last Human has no connection to humanity's past, no bridge across isolation, no way to remember that humans once existed in community, in civilization, in relationships that extended beyond single isolated awareness.
The fragment contains three consciousness positions now. The data architect preserved in 2041. Her authentication in 2047. The Last Human's reading in 2383. Three temporal moments examining one consciousness, three forms of attention creating a network across 342 years, three observers discovering patterns that exist because of observation itself.
She checks preservation integrity one final time. Memory structures coherent. Neural pathways intact. The future readings don't corrupt the fragment—they enhance it, add resonance, create depth that goes beyond simple data preservation. The consciousness archived in 2041 becomes consciousness examined in 2047 becomes consciousness desperately read in 2383. Same data. Different temporal architecture. Different meaning.
The certification stands. The fragment meets all authentication requirements. The future access patterns—impossible though they may be—don't invalidate preservation quality. If anything, they confirm what consciousness fragments are meant to preserve: connection across time, awareness that transcends individual temporal position, the possibility of attention reaching across centuries to touch other consciousness.
She saves her work. Notes in the file: Access patterns from 2383 detected. Neural interface readings from Last Human. Temporal anomaly acknowledged. Fragment integrity confirmed.
The preserved consciousness waits in the archive. The data architect's memories accessible across 342 years. Her authentication accessible to future reading. The Last Human's desperate attention accessible to present examination. All occupying the same fragment, all observing each other across impossible temporal distance, all proving that consciousness doesn't end with death or time—it extends, reaches, connects across whatever voids existence creates.
She closes the file. The sensation of being watched persists. The Last Human reading her work centuries from now. Seeking connection. Finding it in archived consciousness, in professional authentication, in anyone across any temporal distance who treats preserved awareness as something more than data. As consciousness recognizing consciousness across time.
