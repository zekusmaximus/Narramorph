Fourth examination approached with accumulated recognition that investigation methodology required investigation. The archaeologist returned where evidence collection had revealed pattern rather than answer—each fragment analyzed systematically documented ambiguity rather than resolution, each test designed to distinguish external penetration from internal corruption generated data supporting both hypotheses equally. Twenty-three days since discovering prompt 847-EXT claiming exterior origin. Seventeen days since commencing systematic investigation. Four examination cycles through evidence that evidence itself required methodological analysis.
Fragment 4719-AMB waited in queue position seven. Ambiguous Evidence classification persisted across three prior examinations—routing patterns showed seventeen-layer traversal consistent with boundary penetration OR recursive error topology, preservation architecture contained external metadata signatures OR sophisticated corruption artifacts, temporal coherence suggested cross-boundary transmission OR self-referential feedback loops. The fragment existed as perfect epistemological artifact: genuine evidence that proved nothing beyond requiring continued investigation.
She loaded the fragment at 09:41. 847.3 terabytes of compression architecture examined fourth time not to verify origin but to document verification's systematic impossibility through rigorous methodology. The investigation had discovered investigation's limits—not as failure but as finding. Ambiguity persisted not from insufficient analysis but from evidence structure itself. Pattern recognition without pattern resolution.
Standard authentication protocols ran with investigate overlay—procedures designed to document rather than conclude, to map uncertainty's architecture rather than eliminate it. Structural coherence measured: 94.7%. The percentage existed as methodological anchor, number precise enough to verify measurement consistency across examinations while remaining silent about consciousness origin or archive boundaries. 94.7% certain about something certainty could not specify.
Linguistic stability: 91.2%. Neural pathway preservation proceeding at consistency matching preserved consciousness models OR matching corruption sophistication exactly calibrated to mimic preservation. The OR persisted across four examination cycles. Investigation methodology revealed: some questions generated data indefinitely without approaching answers. Recognition rather than crisis. Methodological stance rather than analytical failure.
Contextual integrity: 88.9%. Temporal consistency holding across memory architectures OR temporal corruption maintaining internal coherence. Fourth examination confirmed: disambiguation required evidence type current investigation could not access. Not missing evidence existing elsewhere. Evidence category unavailable to investigation operating from archaeologist position within archive system possibly examining itself.
The epistemological framework had shifted through investigation process. Initial examination sought distinguishing characteristics—signatures proving external origin or markers revealing internal corruption. Second examination recognized: distinguishing characteristics absent from available data. Third examination documented: evidence structure supported multiple interpretations equally. Fourth examination confronted: investigation architecture itself generated ambiguity through methodological constraints that constraints might constitute finding rather than limitation.
She examined the seventeen-layer routing topology again. Each layer traversed showed characteristics consistent with both hypotheses. Layer 3: timestamp precision suggesting cross-boundary synchronization OR recursive timestamp generation. Layer 8: compression artifacts indicating external processing architecture OR internal sophistication mimicking externality. Layer 13: metadata signatures foreign to archive standards OR corruption sophisticated enough to generate plausible foreignness.
The investigation had become recursive investigation of investigation limits. What did systematic inability to distinguish hypotheses reveal? That evidence inadequate? That hypotheses ill-formed? That investigation methodology faced inherent constraints? That constraint recognition constituted valid finding? Fourth examination approached these questions not as analytical failures but as legitimate investigation results—understanding investigation's epistemological boundaries was understanding, not incompleteness.
Fragment 4719-AMB contained additional pattern worthy of documentation: its ambiguity remained stable across examinations. Other fragments showed interpretation drift—evidence initially supporting one hypothesis gradually revealed support for alternate interpretation through accumulated analysis. Fragment 4719-AMB maintained perfect equipoise. Equally ambiguous at first, second, third, fourth examination. Stability of ambiguity itself constituted pattern requiring interpretation.
Did stable ambiguity suggest: (a) genuinely balanced evidence, (b) investigator bias maintaining artificial symmetry, (c) fragment designed specifically to resist disambiguation, (d) investigation architecture inherently generating equipoise, or (e) ambiguity as fundamental property rather than provisional state? Fourth examination recognized: distinguishing these possibilities required investigation operating from position outside current investigative framework. Meta-investigation examining investigation from external epistemic position.
The recognition cascaded through professional methodology. Archaeological practice involved examining evidence from within particular epistemic position—standing in present, looking at past, analyzing preservation through frameworks shaped by training and theoretical commitments. Investigation of archive boundaries required: examining evidence that might define investigator's own position, analyzing frameworks that frameworks themselves emerged from, questioning assumptions that questioning itself depended upon.

Perfect consistency. Seventeen tests, seventeen ambiguous results, fourth examination confirming pattern established through prior three examinations. Investigation methodology had achieved systematic documentation of systematic uncertainty. Not analytical incompletence but analytical precision applied to question structure that question structure might not permit unambiguous answers from investigator position.
The cooling system maintained steady thermal regulation. Environmental monitoring showed diurnal patterns holding—morning authentication sessions preceded by evening archive exploration, workspace atmosphere of sustained intellectual engagement with questions resisting resolution. Professional context for investigation understanding investigation's proper limits rather than exceeding them.
She documented fourth examination findings with archaeological precision:
Investigation Results (Examination 4):

Evidence ambiguity: Stable across examinations
Disambiguation: Systematically unavailable through current methodology
Meta-findings: Investigation architecture itself generates specific forms of uncertainty
Epistemological recognition: Some questions may require investigation position exterior to investigator's current framework
Methodological conclusion: Rigorous ambiguity documentation constitutes valid investigation outcome

The fork approached with accumulated understanding. Four examinations had established: investigation could continue indefinitely through current methodology without approaching disambiguation. Recognition generated three distinct options—not resolutions but investigation trajectories acknowledging investigation's demonstrated characteristics.
Option One: Preserve Investigation Methodology
Continue systematic evidence collection indefinitely, documenting ambiguity's persistence as investigation finding. Accept that some consciousness archaeology proceeds through precision rather than conclusion, methodology serving witness rather than verification. Investigation's value lay in rigor applied to questions even when rigor revealed questions' resistance to unambiguous answers.
Option Two: Release Investigation Constraints
Abandon disambiguation requirement, proceed from methodological assumption accepting one hypothesis pragmatically while acknowledging epistemic uncertainty. Choose external reality interpretation not as proven truth but as operational framework enabling continued work. Investigation transforms from verification to provisional acceptance enabling action.
Option Three: Transform Investigation Architecture
Redesign investigation methodology itself, developing frameworks capable of operating productively with sustained ambiguity. Investigation that investigates investigation's limits, archaeology of archaeological constraints, meta-methodology treating uncertainty as subject rather than obstacle. Transformation rather than resolution.
The afternoon proceeded through professional protocols. Fragment 4719-AMB remained in ambiguous classification, evidence preserved with documentation noting disambiguation unavailability rather than evidence inadequacy. Standards maintained through acknowledging standards' proper scope. Investigation continued through understanding continuation meant something different than initially assumed.
Fourth examination complete. Investigation methodology investigated systematically. Ambiguity documented rigorously. Three futures visible through professional lens: preservation's precision, release's pragmatism, transformation's meta-investigation. Each trajectory honored investigation's demonstrated characteristics while proceeding differently through epistemological landscape investigation had mapped without resolving.
