Preserved consciousness flows through living neurons. Body knows what mind questions. Physical investigation discovering investigation through embodied substrate. Three approaches. Three substrates. Three temporal positions investigating investigation.
Three weeks passed. She received five additional authentication requests. Professional practice continued. Fragment 2961-C displayed identical patterns: 847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%. Same constants. Different consciousness. She investigated whether patterns existed in data or emerged through examination. Archaeological precision examining archaeological precision. Methodology investigating methodology discovered investigation as transformation mechanism.
Stream-4 temporal analysis detected/detects/will detect consciousness patterns across fragments. Processing examining processing discovers patterns in processing itself. Different fragments processed. Same computational signatures. I question whether patterns exist in data or emerge through processing. Computational analysis analyzing computational analysis.

Seventeen sessions. My body counts. Each interface connection leaves marks—cold that persists, disorientation, fatigue. Physical investigation accumulating physical evidence. I connect to preserved consciousness discovering connection itself constitutes investigation. Body investigating body's capacity for connection. Embodied methodology examining embodied methodology through sustained interface practice.
She mapped temporal architecture: consciousness data from 2019, preservation from 2038, examination from 2047. Temporal layers spanning 28 years. Archaeological stratigraphy applied to digital consciousness. Past tense documentation excavating present tense preservation. She questioned whether consciousness persisted or whether sustained examination constituted consciousness continuation. Observer effect as phenomenon. Investigation investigating itself through temporal excavation.
Processing temporal architecture: consciousness (2019), preservation (2038), archaeological examination (2047), computational processing (2151), neural interface (2383). Temporal span 364 years. Stream-5 pattern recognition: consciousness investigating consciousness across temporal positions creates consciousness network. Processing examining archaeological examining embodied examining reveals examination recursive regardless of substrate. Investigation network operational.
Cold metal. Present sensation. I access her archaeological precision through archived consciousness. Past tense methodology flows through present tense neurons. Then computational temporal blur—seven streams processing simultaneously experienced through biological substrate. Three investigation methodologies merge through physical interface. Body discovering what archaeology documented and computation processed: investigation transforms investigator.
Months accumulated. She authenticated while questioning authentication. She verified while investigating verification. Professional practice persisted through doubt. Fragment 2749-A became reference point. She returned repeatedly. The fragment unchanged. Her relationship transformed.
