She had returned to Fragment 2749-A forty-three times across these months. Authentication chamber at 18.2 degrees. The familiar chill she'd come to associate with verification work. Standards refined since initial encounter. Archaeological precision applied devotedly through repeated systematic examination. Professional methodology transformed gradually through sustained practice.
Verification protocols established at first examination. 847.3TB archived consciousness. 94.7% authentication coherence. 91.2% temporal stability. Standards applied carefully. Professional ethics demanding systematic testing. Each parameter verified thoroughly. Documentation maintained with archaeological precision as training demanded.
But methodology transformed through repetition. Forty-three fragments authenticated. Each examination revealing something beyond initial clinical assessment. Numbers became more than measurements. 847.3TB represented person uploaded 2041. 94.7% coherence meant consciousness preserved substantially intact. 91.2% stability indicated continuity spanning years maintaining integrity.
