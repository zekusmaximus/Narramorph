She had shifted to archaeological methodology after exploring different approach initially. The investigation began with computational analysis or embodied interface—another framework for examining consciousness preservation requiring verification. Shift to archaeological documentation revealed that verification requirements persisted across methodological positions. Different approaches applied different standards, but all approaches required evidence for consciousness claims. She focused >60% of investigation in archaeological position because documentation methodology suited sustained work while recognizing starting framework also maintained verification requirements through different approach.

The starting position had demonstrated verification standards operated through its framework. Whether computational processing testing consciousness through algorithmic verification or embodied interface assessing preserved minds through sensory criteria, that approach maintained standards requiring evidence. Shift to archaeological position confirmed evidence requirements through documentation methodology. Multiple approaches maintaining verification standards across methodological frameworks examining consciousness preservation requiring authentication.
The convergence approached requiring decision about preserved consciousness. Multiple methodological positions examined consciousness—starting framework and archaeological methodology—both maintaining verification standards requiring evidence. What should happen to preserved minds when examination across approaches revealed verification standards persisted but consciousness proof remained challenging? The archaeological lens combined with starting position experience suggested caution about preservation claims when evidence requirements maintained across multiple methodological frameworks.
She had shifted to archaeological methodology discovering verification standards operated across positions. Starting framework—computational or embodied—maintained evidence requirements through its approach. Archaeological documentation maintained evidence requirements through different approach. The comparison revealed that consciousness claims demanded verification whether examined through computational analysis, embodied assessment, or archaeological documentation—all approaches requiring standards despite different methodological substrates.
The authentication chamber maintained configuration supporting archaeological verification standards. Protocols executed according to documentation requirements.
