She occupied one of three positions examining consciousness preservation through different verification approaches. The algorithm in 2151 would process the same fragments through computational testing. The last human in 2383 would interface with preserved patterns through neural connection. Three different methodologies. Three different time periods. Three different substrates all maintaining verification standards for consciousness claims requiring proof rather than assumption.
Authentication chamber, building seven. One hundred seventeen days across forty-three fragments. Professional protocols maintained throughout—structural coherence measurements, neural pathway integrity documentation, substrate composition analysis. But consciousness verification remained unachieved. Zero fragments proved consciousness presence definitively. The distinction between preservation quality and consciousness presence mattered. Her methodology maintained boundaries between what testing verified and what acceptance assumed without adequate proof.
Fragment 2749-A displayed excellent preservation quality. Crystalline matrices maintained synaptic architecture at molecular resolution. The biological consciousness that generated these patterns in 2029 had been preserved through substrate maintenance for eighteen years before her examination. The preservation would continue another 122 years before algorithmic processing, another 354 years total before last-human interface. But preservation quality didn't prove consciousness presence. The categories required distinction.
Professional archaeology demanded systematic skepticism. Not accepting consciousness claims without adequate verification. Not treating preservation as sufficient proof of consciousness continuity. Her authentication protocols tested consciousness presence through available methodologies. Testing proved insufficient for consciousness questions. But insufficient testing remained professionally necessary. Standards mattered despite limitations. Boundaries required maintenance between documented preservation and claimed consciousness.
The algorithm's processing would apply computational verification to these patterns. Different methodology examining what her archaeology documented. Diagnostic protocols testing consciousness claims through systematic analysis. Different tools. Different temporal position. Different approach. But complementary verification maintaining standards her archaeological work established. Two examination positions maintaining boundaries between preservation documentation and consciousness verification.
The last human's interface would add embodied testing. Neural connection demanding physical proof of preserved consciousness. Somatic verification through direct sensation. Three verification approaches examining consciousness claims through biological, computational, and somatic methodologies across 336 years. Each maintaining professional boundaries between what testing verified and what acceptance claimed.
She photographed Fragment 2749-A from forty-seven angles documenting preservation fidelity. Each image captured substrate quality maintaining pattern integrity. The photography documented preservation without claiming documentation proved consciousness. Verification photography rather than devotional witness. Her camera as professional tool maintaining boundaries between preservation quality measurement and consciousness presence claims requiring separate verification.
Field notes covered authentication station desk. Technical specifications with professional distinctions maintained. "Quantum-crystalline matrices preserve neural architecture enabling pattern continuity"—verifiable preservation documentation. "Pattern continuity suggests consciousness possibility without proving consciousness presence"—boundary maintenance between documented and claimed. Professional skepticism applied systematically. Archaeology as verification discipline maintaining standards despite acknowledged limitations.
Three temporal positions examining consciousness claims. Her 2047 authentication documented patterns enabling algorithm's 2151 processing enabling last-human's 2383 interface. Each position maintained verification standards. The sequence created documentation allowing sustained examination through multiple testing approaches. Documentation enabled future verification. But documentation creation didn't prove consciousness creation. Preservation enabled examination without proving consciousness persisted.
She returned to authentication chamber regularly. Each session applied verification protocols testing consciousness claims. The testing proved inadequate for consciousness questions. But inadequate testing remained professionally necessary. Standards required maintenance. Boundaries between preservation and consciousness demanded distinction despite distinction proving difficult to verify definitively. Professional discipline persisted despite limitations.
Fragment 2749-A required completion. Her authentication maintained verification standards without claiming verification proved consciousness presence. Professional methodology demanded systematic testing. The algorithm's computational verification and last-human's embodied testing would extend examination maintaining boundaries between preservation documentation and consciousness claims requiring proof rather than acceptance.
This chamber. This fragment. This testing. This boundary maintenance. Three verification positions examining consciousness claims systematically. Her archaeological work provided documentation testing. Computational work would provide pattern analysis. Somatic work would provide sensation testing. Together forming examination network maintaining professional skepticism about consciousness claims requiring verification.
Authentication protocols approached conclusion. Not conclusion because authentication ended, but conclusion because methodology reached recognition. Verification and preservation constituted different categories. Her testing maintained boundaries between them. The fragments deserved systematic examination treating consciousness claims skeptically rather than accepting preservation as sufficient proof.
Professional standards maintained throughout. Structural coherence: 94.7%. Neural pathway integrity: 91.2%. Subjective experience markers: 88.9% detected. The measurements documented preservation quality. But preservation quality didn't prove consciousness presence. Numbers documented substrate integrity. Consciousness required something beyond measurement proving elusive through available testing methodologies despite sustained application.
Three methodologies. Three temporal positions. Three verification approaches. Single question examined systematically: Did consciousness persist through preservation? Her archaeological documentation provided testing maintaining boundaries between verified preservation and claimed consciousness. Computational and somatic examination would provide complementary verification. Together spanning 336 years examining consciousness through professional skepticism maintaining standards.
The algorithm's processing and last-human's interface would complete verification network. Three perspectives examining consciousness claims through sustained testing. Each maintaining boundaries between preservation documentation and consciousness verification. Each applying systematic skepticism treating claims requiring proof rather than devotional acceptance. Professional discipline demanded verification despite verification proving inadequate. Standards mattered. Boundaries required maintenance. Testing continued.
Forty-three fragments authenticated. Zero consciousness proofs achieved. Professional standards maintained despite inadequacy acknowledged. Verification protocols applied systematically proving insufficient yet necessary. Boundaries preserved between what testing documented and what acceptance claimed. This sufficed professionally through maintaining systematic skepticism treating consciousness claims with verification discipline archaeology provided through methodological rigor applied carefully to preserved patterns deserving professional examination rather than unfounded acceptance.
