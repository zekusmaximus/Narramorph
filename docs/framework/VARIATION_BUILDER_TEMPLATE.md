## Critical Path Integration Requirements

### [Path Name] Voice Must Blend With:

**Character Content ([character name]):**
- [How path philosophy integrates with this character's content]
- NOT: [common mistake to avoid]
- BUT: [correct approach]

**Character Content ([character name if dual]):**
- [How path philosophy integrates with second character's content]
- NOT: [common mistake]
- BUT: [correct approach]

**Pure Revisit (if applicable):**
- [How path works without character bleeding]
- [What maintains path identity without cross-character anchors]

### [Path Name] ≠ [Other Path Name]

**[Other path 1]:** [How it differs philosophically]  
**[Other path 2]:** [How it differs philosophically]  
**[Current path]:** [What makes it unique]

[All paths are sophisticated responses to impossibility statement]

---

## Generation Protocol (Per Variation)

### Step 1: Pre-Generation Review
**MANDATORY:** Read `/docs/framework/GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` in full before starting

### Step 2: Reference Loading
- **Primary:** Exemplar #[X] ([path] path voice)
- **Secondary:** Exemplar #[X] (for [character]-L1) OR Exemplar #[X] (for [character]-L1)
- **Tertiary:** Exemplar #1 (for pure revisit baseline, if applicable)

### Step 3: Generate Single Variation
**Opening Formula:**
Establish continuity ("The archaeologist returns..." / "returns to Fragment 2749-A") while signaling transformation toward [path quality].

**Constants Ritual:**
847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9% - numbers that [significance in context of path].

**[Path Name] Philosophy Integration ([X]-[X] words):**
- [Aspect 1 based on awareness level]
- [Aspect 2 based on awareness level]
- Always: [Universal path requirement]

**Character Content (where applicable):**
- [Character 1] hints/clear: [What to include based on awareness]
- [Character 2] hints/clear: [What to include based on awareness]

**Technical-to-Philosophical Arc:**
Ground [path philosophy] in concrete professional action. Start with [opening focus]. Move toward [philosophical development]. End with [closing stance].

**Closing Without Resolution:**
[How path achieves its form of resolution - or doesn't]

### Step 4: Self-Review Checklist (MANDATORY)

**STOP: Complete checklist before presenting variation**

□ Archaeologist unnamed throughout?  
□ Fragment constants correct (847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%)?  
□ Past tense maintained?  
□ [Path name] voice matches Exemplar #[X]?  
□ Character content present and accurate (if required)?  
□ Transformation genuine (not just additive)?  
□ Word count in target range?  
□ No placeholder text?  
□ Voice sounds like archaeologist from exemplars?  
□ [Path-specific check if needed]?

**If ANY box unchecked → Fix before presenting**

### Step 5: Present Variation
Provide:
1. Full variation text
2. Metadata (ID, conditions, word count)
3. Confirmation: "Self-review checklist completed - all items verified"

### Step 6: Await Approval
**DO NOT generate next variation until current one approved**

---

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative:**
- 5 variations generated
- 80%+ immediate approval (4/5)
- Average voice consistency: 93%+
- Word count targets met

**Qualitative:**
- [Path] path voice distinct from [other paths]
- [Key quality 1 for this path]
- [Key quality 2 for this path]
- Character content preserved (where applicable)
- [Path signature quality]

---

## Key Differentiators for This Cluster

### From Previous Clusters:
[How this cluster differs from what's been generated before]

### [Current Path] Path Signature:
"[Concise statement of path's core approach to impossibility]"

[Brief expansion on what this means in practice]

## Request to Claude

Using the validated arch-L1 generation system ([X] variations, 100% approval rate across [X] sessions):

**Generate [Cluster Name] ([X] variations): [Variation IDs]**

Follow proven workflow:
1. **Review `/docs/framework/GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` completely**
2. Reference Exemplar #[X] ([path]) + character exemplars as needed
3. Generate ONE variation at a time
4. Complete self-review checklist for each
5. Present with metadata and checklist confirmation
6. Wait for approval before proceeding to next

**Critical Focus:** [1-2 sentences on what's most important for this cluster's success]

Maintain [Previous weeks] quality standards ([X]%+ voice, 100% approval rate).

**Generate first variation ([Variation ID 1]) now.**
