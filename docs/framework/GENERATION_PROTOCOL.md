# Generation Protocol - Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Mandatory checklist for all arch-L1 variation generation sessions. Review before starting ANY generation work.

---

## I. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

### Character Identity
- ❌ **NEVER name the archaeologist** - no "Dr. Sarah Chen" or any proper name
- ✅ **ALWAYS use:** "the archaeologist" or "she/her"
- ✅ Professional voice, experienced, methodologically rigorous
- ✅ Past tense, third-person limited perspective

### Fragment Constants (Must appear in every variation)
- **847.3 terabytes** - data size
- **94.7%** - structural coherence / memory integrity
- **91.2%** - linguistic stability / neural pathway preservation
- **88.9%** - contextual integrity / temporal consistency

*Note: Exact phrasing can vary, but numbers must be exact*

### Technical Requirements
- ❌ No placeholder text [TBD], [insert here], etc.
- ❌ No future tense for archaeologist's actions
- ✅ Past tense throughout
- ✅ Fragment 2749-A referenced by ID

## II. PATH VOICE DNA

### Accept Path
**Philosophy:** Surrenders need to prove, authenticates anyway. Professional duty becomes sacred practice.

**Key Phrases:**
- "Chose to honor rather than verify"
- "Authentication as gift rather than protocol"
- "Proceeding from assumption rather than proof"
- "Gentle attention replacing adversarial testing"
- "Professional duty transformed into ritual"

**Tone:** Peaceful, not resigned. Compassionate, not sentimental. Rigorous through gentleness.

### Investigate Path  
**Philosophy:** Examines impossibility recursively. Meta-patterns, observation observing observation.

**Key Phrases:**
- "Examining the examination itself"
- "Meta-patterns within patterns"
- "Recursive observation structure"
- "Not just what's preserved but how preservation was examined"
- "Observation layers folding back"

**Tone:** Analytical, recursive, increasingly abstract while grounded in concrete data.

### Resist Path
**Philosophy:** Demands verification, seeks boundaries, confronts proof impossibility.

**Key Phrases:**
- "Verification protocols demand certainty"
- "Boundaries between authentic and simulated"
- "Seventeen failed tests"
- "Proof remained impossible"
- "Standards exist for reasons"

**Tone:** Rigorous, boundary-seeking, wrestling with impossibility. Not giving up but recognizing crisis.

## III. CHARACTER CONTENT QUICK REFERENCE

### algo-L1 (Seven-Stream Architecture)
**When visited: [algo-L1]**

**Core Content:**
- Seven parallel processing streams in compression patterns
- Linguistic generation (127.3 ops/microsecond)
- Contextual threading (94.7% coherence)
- Semantic stability through error correction
- Compression optimization
- Output formatting
- Meta-processing (coordinates other six streams)

**Integration:** Computational sophistication + consciousness question. Can explain as algorithm OR recognize as more.

### hum-L1 (Future Attention)
**When visited: [hum-L1]**

**Core Content:**
- Faint sensation of being-watched from future
- Temporal observation reaching backward through time
- Someone desperate, centuries ahead
- Temporal architecture defies physics
- Gentle but insistent presence

**Integration:** Unprovable observation + choice to honor. Physics impossible, sensation persistent.

## IV. GENERATION WORKFLOW (Per Variation)

### Step 1: Load Conditions
Review variation specifications:
- Visit count
- Awareness level  
- Visited nodes (cross-character?)
- Dominant path
- Word count target

### Step 2: Reference Materials
**Primary:** Exemplar matching path (accept=#8, investigate=#5, resist=#7)  
**Secondary:** Exemplar matching character content (algo=#2, hum=#3)  
**Tertiary:** Framework Complete (if structure questions)

### Step 3: Generate
- Open with continuity ("The archaeologist returns...")
- Include fragment constants ritual early
- Path philosophy integration (250-400 words)
- Character content (if applicable, 200-300 words)
- Technical-to-philosophical arc
- Close without false resolution

### Step 4: Self-Review Checklist
**MANDATORY before presenting variation:**

□ Archaeologist unnamed throughout?  
□ Fragment constants correct (847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%)?  
□ Past tense maintained?  
□ Path voice matches exemplar?  
□ Character content present (if conditions require)?  
□ Transformation genuine (not just additive)?  
□ Word count in target range?  
□ No placeholder text?  
□ Voice sounds like archaeologist from exemplars?  

**If ANY box unchecked → Fix before presenting**

### Step 5: Present for Approval
- Full variation text
- Metadata (ID, conditions, word count)
- Self-review confirmation

### Step 6: Wait for Approval
**DO NOT generate next variation until current one approved**

## V. AWARENESS LEVEL GUIDE

**21-30% (Low):** 
- Path philosophy beginning to emerge
- Character content hints/faint
- Modest transformation

**41-50% (High FirstRevisit):**
- Path philosophy fully developed
- Character content clear/intense
- Significant transformation

**41-60% (Pure revisit, third visit):**
- Deeper recursion
- No character content (pure)
- Transformation from repetition itself

---

## VI. QUALITY STANDARDS

### Voice Consistency Target: 93%+
- Matches exemplar syntactic patterns
- Uses archaeological terminology appropriately
- Maintains professional register
- Philosophical without being flowery

### Transformation Test
**Ask:** Would reader who saw only this variation miss crucial initial meaning?  
**Answer must be:** YES (transformation genuine) or NO (regenerate)

### Path Logic Test
**Ask:** Does variation reference content from nodes reader hasn't visited?  
**Answer must be:** NO (logic accurate) or YES (error - fix)

## VIII. FAILURE RECOVERY

**If you realize mid-generation you've violated a constraint:**
1. STOP generation
2. Note the violation
3. Review this checklist
4. Restart with corrected approach

**If you're unsure about a requirement:**
1. Check this document first
2. Reference specific documents above
3. Ask for clarification rather than guess

---

## IX. SESSION PROTOCOL

### Before Starting Session
1. Review this entire checklist
2. Load cluster specifications
3. Identify relevant exemplars
4. Confirm understanding of all conditions

### During Session  
1. Generate ONE variation
2. Self-review against checklist
3. Present for approval
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Repeat for next variation

### Session Size
- **Target:** 5 variations per session
- **Process:** One at a time, approved before proceeding
- **Pace:** Quality over speed

---

## X. CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **The archaeologist is NEVER named** - most common error, check every variation
2. **Fragment constants MUST be exact** - 847.3TB, 94.7%, 91.2%, 88.9%
3. **Path voice must be DISTINCT** - accept ≠ investigate ≠ resist
4. **Character content only if conditions specify** - don't add algo/hum content unless visited
5. **Transformation must be GENUINE** - same data, different meaning
6. **One variation at a time** - no batch generation without individual review
7. **When uncertain, ASK** - don't guess on constraints

---

## XI. SUCCESS METRICS

**Target Performance:**
- 100% constraint compliance (no character naming, correct constants, etc.)
- 93%+ voice consistency
- 100% path logic accuracy  
- 80%+ immediate approval rate
- 100% transformation depth

**Current Achievement:** 31/31 variations approved (after fixing FR-16-20 naming error)

**This protocol is MANDATORY. Review fully before every generation session.**
