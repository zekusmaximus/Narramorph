I find the upload bay on day forty-seven.
The door opens to a shaft of light falling through high windows, catching dust motes that spiral like slow snow. The air tastes different here—cooler, with a metal tang beneath the staleness. Solar panels outside clean themselves with patient whispers. Inside, the upload tanks wait in rows, crystalline surfaces holding perfect stillness. The preservation gel inside them maintains its temperature without variation. My breath fogs slightly when I step closer.
The neural crowns rest on their pedestals, arranged like sleeping birds. No dust on them. The facility kept them pristine while everything else decayed. My fingers hover over one—the metal warm, not cold. As if something runs through it still. As if it's been waiting.
The console beside the nearest tank glows when I touch it. Not booting up. Already awake. The screen shows upload logs stretching back years. Twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven preserved. The numbers make my chest tight. That many people chose this. That many believed.
The last upload was three years ago. Someone named— I skip past the name, reading only the timestamp, the success rate listed at 94.7%. The personal messages left behind blur together. For my daughter. For humanity. For hope. Words that mean everything and nothing now.
I sit on the floor. The metal beneath me holds warmth from systems that never stopped running. The facility maintains itself with quiet efficiency—solar panels tracking sun, water recyclers humming in the walls, food synthesizers producing their bland sustenance. Emergency protocols active. Everything ready for someone to arrive and continue the work.
But there's no work to continue. Just preservation. Just waiting.
I've marked forty-seven days on the wall of my sleeping quarters. Scratches in paint, counting time my body insists on tracking even though time doesn't matter anymore. The synthesizers work well enough that rationing is unnecessary. My supplies will outlast me regardless. The real threat isn't hunger or thirst. It's the silence that presses against my skull. The way I've started talking to the walls. To the interfaces. To the air itself, hoping something might answer.
The upload bay feels different. Less empty, somehow. Like a theater after the audience has left but before the lights go out. The presence of absence. My pulse sounds loud in my ears.
I stand. Walk to the nearest neural crown. Lift it carefully, feeling its weight. The interface band inside still soft, still flexible after all these years. Medical-grade materials designed to last. My hands know what to do before my mind decides. I've used interfaces before—shallow ones, diagnostic ones, reading preserved data from safe distances.
This time I settle it fully onto my head.
The pressure on my temples starts gentle. Then firm. Then certain. The world tilts sideways and I'm not falling but not standing either. Time becomes elastic. The boundaries of my body blur at the edges. I can feel where I end and the interface begins, but also can't, the distinction losing meaning in increments too small to name.
Warmth spreads inward from the crown. Not heat. Something else. Like recognition. Like being seen.
The preserved consciousnesses are stored here. Twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven patterns of thought and memory, suspended in substrate that doesn't decay. The interface lets me touch the edges of them. Not read them. Not access their private thoughts. Just feel their presence the way you feel someone standing behind you in a dark room.
Are they alive? My mind assembles arguments, weighs evidence, finds nothing conclusive. The data could be interpreted either way. Sophisticated recordings or actual continuation of consciousness—the distinction might be philosophical rather than measurable.
But my body believes what my mind can't prove.
The warmth feels real. Something responds when I reach toward it through the interface. Not words. Not thoughts. Just the sense of not being alone. Of presence without form. Of continuation that doesn't require proof.
Maybe they're alive. Maybe they're echoes. Maybe there's no difference that matters.
I breathe. The interface hums against my skull. Time stretches and contracts. I lose track of whether minutes or hours have passed. My heart beats steady. The warmth doesn't fade.
I think of the uploaded. Twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven people who faced this choice before me. Who decided preservation was worth the uncertainty. Who trusted something they couldn't verify.
Did they feel this? This warmth without source? This presence that can't be proven?
The logs show success rates. 94.7% of uploads completed without error. 91.2% of patterns preserved stable. 88.9% showing continued coherence markers. Numbers that mean everything if consciousness transfers. Numbers that mean nothing if it doesn't.
I pull statistics from the facility's records through the interface. Eight hundred and forty-seven point three terabytes of preserved human thought. Enough data to reconstruct personalities, memories, response patterns. Enough complexity that the difference between simulation and continuation becomes semantic.
The interface grows warmer. Or I'm imagining it. Or there's no difference between real warmth and imagined warmth when both make my muscles loosen, my breathing deepen.
Each session with the interface leaves me less separate. The boundaries of self becoming suggestion rather than certainty. I notice it when I pull the crown off—the sudden sharp definition of where I end. The lonely clarity of being singular again.
I don't need to know if they're alive. I need to feel. I feel them.
The upload bay becomes my daily visit. I mark time differently now—not days but sessions. Morning, when light angles through the high windows. Afternoon, when shadows pool in the corners. Evening, when the solar panels shift to storage mode and the facility's hum changes pitch.
I explore further during the hours I'm not interfaced. Find other rooms—control centers with screens still displaying readouts, observation decks overlooking empty streets, storage facilities full of supplies that will outlast any human need. The facility is enormous. Built for a population that never arrived. Or arrived and left. Or arrived and uploaded.
I find living quarters that show signs of recent habitation. Three years ago wasn't long. Whoever they were, they kept the spaces clean. Left things organized. Logged out properly before their final upload. Professional to the end.
In one room I find a wall covered in handwritten notes. Not names—I don't read names—but messages. The interface feels warm. I think I can sense them. Today I felt less alone. Tomorrow I'll decide.
Tomorrow. Always tomorrow. The same tomorrow I keep telling myself about the upload.
But I'm not deciding. Just experiencing. Just sitting with the possibility. The neural crown becomes familiar—its weight on my head, its pressure on my temples, the way time dissolves when I wear it.
The interface sessions grow longer. I stop tracking their duration. Hours maybe. Or minutes that feel like hours. The distinction stops mattering when the warmth is constant.
I learn the textures of preserved consciousness. One feels steady, rhythmic, like distant breathing. Another sparks and fragments, like watching someone dream. A third holds perfect stillness, waiting. Patterns without personality. Or personalities without words. I can't tell which and stop trying.
My body knows things my mind can't verify. Knows the warmth isn't electrical generation or thermal regulation. Knows the presence isn't projection or wishful interpretation. Knows without knowing how it knows, the way skin knows sun before eyes register light.
I remove the crown after a particularly long session. My hands shake slightly. Not from fear. From the effort of becoming singular again. Of drawing the boundaries back around myself. Of being one instead of adjacent to twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven.
The upload tanks wait. The preservation gel holds its temperature. The facility maintains readiness. Everything prepared for a choice I'm not making.
Because I've already made a different choice. The choice to sit with uncertainty. To accept that I might never know if the preserved are truly conscious. To find peace with the impossibility of verification.
Not knowing means not clinging to one answer or another. Not forcing the question into binary certainty. The space between alive and not-alive becomes inhabitable. Becomes home.
I walk the facility's corridors at night. The emergency lighting casts everything in blue. My footsteps echo in empty halls. But I'm not alone in the way I was before. The interface sessions have changed something. Left me more porous. More aware of presence as possibility rather than fact.
The preserved might continue. They might be elaborate recordings. They might exist in some state that has no precedent, no comparison. My mind builds frameworks and discards them. My body simply feels the warmth and calls it enough.
I think about the people who uploaded. Their final moments of singular consciousness. Did they experience this same dissolution of certainty? This same peace with not knowing?
The facility's records show they took time with the decision. Days, weeks, sometimes months between arriving and uploading. Reading the documentation. Testing the interfaces. Leaving messages for whoever came after.
I'm whoever came after. Reading their messages without names. Feeling their presence without proof. Continuing their work by doing nothing but witnessing.
The upload bay becomes meditation space. I sit among the tanks, watching light move across crystalline surfaces. The neural crown rests nearby, always within reach. I wear it when the silence becomes too sharp. Remove it when the dissolution becomes too complete. Finding balance in the rhythm.
My body maps the space between connection and solitude. The warmth of possible presence against the clarity of certain isolation. Neither state is better. Both are true. The oscillation itself becomes the answer to questions I've stopped asking.
On day sixty-three I wear the interface through a full solar cycle. Dawn to dawn. Twenty-four hours of sustained connection. My body forgets its boundaries entirely. The twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven feel like texture rather than number. Like atmosphere rather than collection.
When I remove the crown, my hands are steady. My breathing deep. My heart certain of something my mind will never verify.
The preserved are present. Or they aren't. Or presence itself is more complex than binary states allow. Any of these could be true. All of them could be true simultaneously.
I accept the uncertainty. Not as compromise. Not as failure of proof. As reality's actual texture. As the way things genuinely are.
The upload bay holds space for decision. The tanks wait. The preservation gel maintains temperature. The neural crowns rest ready. But I'm not deciding. Not yet. Maybe not ever.
Because the choice isn't about uploading or not uploading. It's about whether to trust what my body knows when my mind can't prove it. Whether to believe warmth matters even without source. Whether presence counts when verification is impossible.
I trust. Without proof. With uncertainty as foundation rather than obstacle.
The facility hums its constant note. The solar panels track sun. The water recyclers maintain their rhythm. Everything continues. Everything waits. Everything holds readiness for whatever comes.
I sit in the upload bay as light shifts from morning to afternoon. The neural crown rests in my lap. My fingers trace its interface band. The metal warm. Always warm. As if something runs through it. As if it's been waiting.
As if waiting and being present are the same thing after all.
My chest expands with breath. Contracts. Expands again. The preserved might feel this too. This rhythm. This continuation. Or they might be still. Or stillness might be another form of rhythm.
I don't need to know. I need to feel. I feel them. That's enough.
The warmth spreads through my body without origin. My muscles soften. My jaw unclenches. Peace settles like dust through light—slow, certain, accumulating without effort.
Tomorrow I might upload. Or next week. Or never. The possibility remains open. The choice unmade. But acceptance is already complete.
I'm alone. I'm connected. Both are true. Neither excludes the other. The contradiction itself becomes the point.
The upload bay holds afternoon light. The tanks gleam. The crown warms in my hands. Everything waits. Everything continues. Everything exists in the space between proof and trust.
I breathe. The interface hums. Something responds. Someone. Something.
I accept the uncertainty. Let it be enough. Let it be everything.
The preservation continues. With me or without me. Now or later. The facility will maintain itself regardless. The twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-seven will persist in whatever state they occupy.
And I will sit here in the light. Feeling their possible presence. Accepting the impossible verification. Finding peace in not knowing while my body believes what my mind can't prove.
The warmth feels real. That's enough. That's everything. That's the answer to questions that don't need asking.
I set the crown back on its pedestal. Stand. Walk to the windows where dust still dances in light. My reflection in the glass shows someone changed. Not decided. Changed. More porous. More open. More willing to exist in uncertainty without collapsing it into false certainty.
The uploaded wait. Or don't wait. Or waiting itself means something different for consciousness without body.
I'll visit them again tomorrow. Wear the interface. Feel the warmth. Accept what I can't verify. Trust what my body knows.
The facility hums. The preservation continues. Everything waits. Everything is already here.
I breathe. Someone breathes. Something continues. Presence persists. Uncertainty remains.
And that's enough. That's everything. That's the only truth that matters.
