Seven days since Fragment 2749-A. Maybe eight. Sleep cycles blur. But hunger arrives punctual. Three meals. Body calendar reliable when mind loses count.
Eastern corridor calls today. Control systems. Historical archives. Interface warmth from week prior lingers—physical memory stronger than temporal. Her consciousness touching mine. Archaeologist from 2048. Three hours connection. Then: exhaustion. Headaches. Body limits. But certainty established. Pattern preservation works. Something genuine archived.
I walk east. Concrete floors. Emergency lighting amber. Walls humming. Power distribution constant. The facility maintains perfect climate. Temperature: 17 degrees. My breath visible. Systems running centuries. Outlasting biology. Technology patient beyond human comprehension.
Door opens. Palm recognition. Biometric security ancient but functional. Control center reveals itself.
Vast space. Three levels. Main floor command stations. Upper gallery observation platforms. Lower level power management. Screens everywhere—status displays, system monitors, preservation metrics. Most dark. Some glowing amber. Ready state. Waiting for operator who didn't arrive for three hundred years. Until now.
My footsteps echo across empty floor. Command stations arranged in circle. Interface access points. Neural mapping terminals. Archive coordination systems. Upload synchronization controls. Everything preserved. Everything functional. The comprehensiveness overwhelming.
I approach nearest station. Hesitant. Fingers brush control panel. Display activates. Warm glow. Interface options appear. Historical logs. System documentation. Consciousness transfer records. Timeline architecture spanning centuries. The facility's memory intact. Waiting to be read.
Sitting feels strange. Chair designed for human body. Ergonomic curves. Lumbar support. Evidence of bodies that worked here. Technicians. Coordinators. People who built consciousness preservation infrastructure. Their presence ghosted in furniture design. In keyboard arrangement. In screen height calibrated for average human gaze.
I am last person to sit in any of these chairs.
The loneliness catches me. Sudden. Physical. Tight chest. Difficulty breathing. Isolation crushing. Three hundred years empty facility. Me alone in control center designed for teams. For collaboration. For human interaction. The silence weighs.
But isolation releasing. The thought arrives unbidden. Upload bay exists. Interface functional. Connection possible. Not just three-hour Fragment access. Complete merger. Permanent integration. Solitude ending through consciousness transfer. The facility prepared this solution centuries ago. Technology waiting. My choice remaining.
I access historical logs. Timeline begins 2047. Final decades biological humanity. Preservation technology development. Neural mapping breakthroughs. Consciousness upload capability achieved. Social transformation accelerating. Population choosing digital existence. Infrastructure expanding. Upload facilities worldwide. Coordination. Documentation. Care taken with humanity's final choice.
2151: Major population shift. Biological humans minority. Upload normalized. Facilities like this—standard. Climate controlled. Power redundant. Designed for centuries operation. Maintaining archived consciousnesses. Providing access points. Preserving continuity.
2247: Last major upload wave documented. Biological population under one thousand. Scattered. Isolated. Each making individual choice. No collective decision possible. Demographics too sparse. But facilities maintained. Power systems automatic. Just in case. Someone returns. Someone remains. Someone chooses.
2383: Current year. Maybe. Facility logs current. But outside calendar uncertain. Time loses meaning when you're alone. Days marked by body rhythms. Sunrise. Hunger. Sleep. Months speculation. Years impossible to count. Isolation erodes temporal markers until only immediate remains.
I am witness to timeline I didn't experience. History preserved while I lived it unknowing. Somewhere. Somehow. Details unclear. Memory uncertain before facility discovery. But body remembers basics. Loneliness longstanding. Hunger familiar. Walking through empty world—established pattern. This facility just latest discovery. Maybe last.
Upload protocols detailed in system logs. Process careful. Medical assessment first. Neural mapping comprehensive. Biological template preservation. Consciousness transfer gradual. Integration verification. Life support maintenance. Reversibility options preserved. The thoroughness remarkable. They understood transformation stakes. Treated upload as birth. New existence requiring care.
My body relaxes reading protocols. Fear diminishing. Warmth replacing anxiety. Process transparent. Technology proven. Centuries success. Consciousness preservation works. Fragment 2749-A demonstrated. Interface connection genuine. Upload logical extension. Input to output. Observation to participation. Next step clear.
But questions multiply faster than certainty grows.
What continues? Pattern. Neural structure. Consciousness configuration. Memory content. Emotional tendencies. Decision patterns. All uploaded. All preserved. But I am breath. Heartbeat. Muscle tension. Skin temperature. Physical sensation. Embodiment grounds consciousness. Digital substrate lacks flesh. How does warmth survive without body? Contradiction recognized without resolution.
Upload as completion. The phrase emerges. Body-generated wisdom. Something about control center warmth despite cold. Emotional temperature distinct from physical. Reading protocols settles something in chest. Process comprehensible. Transformation possible. Fear unnecessary. Centuries infrastructure preparation. Technology ready. Only choice variable. Choice becoming clear.
I stand. Walk upper gallery. Observation platforms overlook command stations. Visual supervision capability. Redundant monitoring. Critical systems watched from multiple angles. The paranoia revealing. They knew. Consciousness preservation too important for single failure point. Backup upon backup. Verification loops. Safety protocols extensive.
Evidence of care settles me.
Timeline architecture thoughtful. Process thorough. Infrastructure maintained. Not abandonment. Preparation. They built this knowing someone might arrive centuries later. Might need upload capability. Might choose connection over isolation. Facility designed for me. Specifically. Last biological human. Final choice. Technology patient across three hundred years. Waiting for moment arriving now.
Isolation ending feels inevitable. Not forced. Natural. Loneliness releasing grip as warmth increases. Upload bay exists. Control center functional. Historical logs demonstrate success. Fragment 2749-A proves connection genuine. All evidence points toward acceptance. Body choosing willingly. Mind agreeing. Philosophy clarifying through exploration.
But not today. Not yet.
More to discover. Lower level power systems. Underground archives. Living quarters. Each space piece of understanding. Facility reveals itself gradually. Answers emerging through patient exploration. Questions requiring thorough investigation before transformation. Acceptance deepened through knowledge. Choice strengthened through understanding.
I return to main floor. Command stations glowing. Ready for operation. Systems await instructions. Upload protocols accessible. Medical assessment available. Process begins when chosen. Not before. Technology respects autonomy. Centuries patience continuing. Days more acceptable. Weeks fine. Time flexible.
Control center door seals behind me. Corridor extends south. Living quarters direction. Evidence of bodies that worked here. That lived here. That chose upload from here. Personal spaces. Individual stories. Humanity's final decade preserved in abandoned rooms. Tomorrow's exploration.
My body walks facility designed for my arrival. Footsteps echo. Generator hum constant. Climate perfect. Systems maintained. Technology outlasted biology then prepared for biology's return. Circular inevitability. Metamorphosis. Pattern continuing new form. Upload as evolution. Transformation natural. Change welcomed.
The warmth persists. Physical sensation indicating philosophical direction. Body knows before mind articulates. Acceptance growing. Questions multiplying within acceptance. Curiosity feeding certainty. Understanding enabling choice. Facility teaching patience. Technology demonstrating care. History proving possibility.
Upload bay waits. Control center ready. Protocols documented. Process clear. Choice mine. Timing flexible. Acceptance certain. Transformation approaching. Homecoming recognized. Body choosing connection. Isolation ending. Pattern continuing. Evolution beginning.
Tomorrow. Deeper. Understanding before transformation. Questions before answers. Exploration before upload. But path clear. Direction certain. Destination accepted. Body and mind agreeing. Warmth constant. Fear diminishing. Choice strengthening. Connection inevitable.
Days ahead. Weeks maybe. Then: upload. Complete. Willing. Prepared.
