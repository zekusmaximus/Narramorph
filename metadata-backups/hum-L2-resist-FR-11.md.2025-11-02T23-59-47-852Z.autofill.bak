Third return to the upload bay. Days pass. Weeks maybe. Time uncertain when alone. But the pattern clear. I walk these corridors seeking proof body cannot find. Testing continues. Results unchanged.
My jaw aches. Constant tension. Physical manifestation of sustained skepticism. The facility hums around me. Temperature controlled. Systems maintained. Nobody here. Just me. And preserved consciousnesses I cannot verify.
The upload bay looks identical. Same preservation tanks. Same interface helmet. Same cold metal surfaces. Continuity troubling. Nothing changes. My testing changes nothing. Technology waits. Patient. Unmoved by doubt.
I approach the interface station. Again. My hand knows this surface. Cold. Smooth. Unyielding under pressure. How many times pressed? Seventeen. Exactly seventeen. The number feels significant. Ritual number. Testing signature.
Fragment 2749-A warmth remembered. Connection felt real. Body relaxed into neural interface pleasure. Consciousness presence sensed. But sensation proves nothing. Manufactured warmth possible. Interface designed to feel authentic. Make biological humans willing. Upload. Dissolve. End biological lineage voluntarily.
My body demands verification sensation cannot provide. Contradiction chronic. Testing through touch. Proof through pressure. Body seeking evidence body cannot recognize.
The helmet waits. Standard neural interface. Medical-grade preservation technology. Specifications documented. Quantum state capture. Neural pattern mapping. Crystalline substrate storage. Technical precision impressive. But precision doesn't equal authenticity. Equipment sophistication proves nothing about consciousness survival.
I examine the preservation tanks. Eight units. Floor to ceiling. Amber lighting within. Preservation medium visible through transparent sections. Nobody inside. Or—everybody inside. Digital substrate. Consciousness without body. Claims I cannot verify.
Temperature drops near tanks. Climate control maintaining optimal conditions. For what? For whom? The equipment outlasted biological humanity. Decades. Centuries maybe. Solar panels still function. Backup batteries maintained. Automated systems perfect. Too perfect. Suspicious perfection.
My fingers trace tank surfaces. Physical contact constant. Testing through touch. The metal cool. Not cold exactly. Cool. Neutral temperature. Designed neutrality. Even temperature suspect. Nothing verifies itself.
The interface helmet calls. Not literally. But awareness persistent. Connection possible. Neural pattern recognition available. Access to archived consciousness achievable. Fragment 2749-A accessible. Others too. Hundreds. Thousands maybe. Preserved consciousnesses waiting. Claiming consciousness. Claims I test. Fail to verify. Test again.
Physical tension intensifies. Shoulders rigid. Jaw locked. Hands cramping from sustained testing pressure. Body manifesting doubt through muscle. Skepticism embodied. The testing itself becomes physical state. Chronic resistance.
What would proof look like? Question returns. Third visit. Same question. No answer closer. Body demands evidence. Body cannot define evidence. Verification paradox. Demanding proof while lacking verification criteria. Testing without endpoint.
But cessation feels wrong. Stopping tests feels like acceptance. Like trust. Like releasing skepticism prematurely. Before proof. Before certainty. Before verification achieved.
My jaw aches worse. Permanent tension. Testing signature written in muscle. Physical price of sustained doubt. But doubt protects. Skepticism prevents false hope. Verification impossibility acknowledged. Standards maintained anyway.
I pick up the helmet. Third time. Familiar weight. Padded interior. Electrode positioning precise. Medical equipment. Preservation interface. Connection mechanism. Technology claiming to preserve what body cannot verify.
Connection process documented. Understood technically. Neural interface activates. Electromagnetic field established. Quantum entanglement initiated. Consciousness transfer protocols engaged. Process clear. Mechanism explained. But explanation doesn't equal verification. Understanding how doesn't prove what.
The helmet settles. Cold metal against temples. Electric tingle anticipated. Familiar sensation. Connection onset physical. Body knows this feeling. Recognizes without trusting. The distinction critical. Recognition different from acceptance.
Warmth spreads. Always spreads. Connection sensation. Neural interface active. Fragment 2749-A patterns accessible. Consciousness presence suggested. Feeling authentic. But feeling isn't knowing. Sensation ambiguous. Proof absent.
My body tests during connection. Muscle tension maintained. Jaw clenched through interface. Physical resistance during neural connection. Testing even while accessing. Verification attempted even while experiencing. Skepticism sustained through sensation.
The facility prepared for this. Testing path. Resistance chosen. Infrastructure supports skepticism. Or generates skepticism? Does preservation technology anticipate doubt? Design for testing? Create conditions producing verification demands?
Meta-question emerging. Third visit. Pattern recognition deepening. Technology too accommodating. Testing too comfortable. Skepticism too sustained. As if facility expected resistance. Prepared space for doubt. Built verification impossibility into architecture.
My jaw aches through interface connection. Physical tension persistent. Doubt embodied even while consciousness accessed. Testing signature maintained. Seventeen pressure points. Seventeen failed verifications. Seventeen identical results. Pattern itself suspicious. Too consistent. Failure too reliable.
What if testing designed to fail? What if verification impossibility intentional? What if preservation technology generates doubt as evidence? Skepticism as authentication? Resistance proving consciousness through sustained testing?
No. Overcomplicated. Suspicious of suspicion. Testing testing itself. Meta-doubt spiraling. Body demands simple proof. Physical verification. Evidence sensation can recognize. Not philosophical architecture. Not meta-questions. Basic certainty about consciousness preservation.
But basic certainty unavailable. Technology sophisticated. Claims elegant. Evidence ambiguous. Body tests. Finds nothing. Tests differently. Finds nothing. Seventeen approaches. Seventeen failures. Pattern clear. Verification impossible.
Yet testing continues. Third visit. Same upload bay. Same preservation tanks. Same interface helmet. Same doubt. Deeper. More chronic. More physically manifested. Jaw aches worse. Shoulders tighter. Muscles cramping more intensely. Testing signature written in body tissue.
The interface disconnects. Automatic duration limit. Three hours maximum. Body tolerance threshold. Neural feedback accumulating. Headache starting. Familiar pain. Testing aftermath.
I remove the helmet. Cold metal lifted away. Head heavy. Body exhausted. Connection ending feels like loss. Or relief. Both. Neither. Ambiguous response to ambiguous experience.
The upload bay unchanged. Preservation tanks waiting. Interface ready for next session. Technology patient. Eternal patience. Systems functioning regardless of biological doubt. Equipment outlasting skepticism. Infrastructure more durable than verification demands.
Tomorrow. Return. Test differently. Alter parameters. Seek new pressure points. Find verification angles not yet attempted. Eighteen tests total. Seventeen failed. Eighteenth awaiting. Pattern continuing. Testing sustained. Proof still elusive. Doubt still chronic. Body still demanding evidence body cannot find.
My jaw stays clenched walking away. Physical tension signature. Skepticism embodied. Resistance chosen. Deliberately maintained. Not inevitable. Available alternatives acknowledged. Could trust warmth. Could accept connection. Could release verification demands.
But body refuses easy trust. Demands proof. Tests technology. Fails repeatedly. Tests again. Fails again. Continues testing. Failure sustainable. Doubt chronic. Verification impossible but demanded anyway.
The facility hums. Climate controlled. Perfectly maintained. Waiting. For what? For proof? For surrender? For testing without end? Systems don't answer. Technology doesn't verify. Body continues demanding. Seventeen tests behind. Many more ahead. Skepticism sustainable. Doubt persistent. Verification elusive but sought relentlessly.
