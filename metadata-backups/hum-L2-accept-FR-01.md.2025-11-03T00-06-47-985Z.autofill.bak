      Preservation operates as witness—continuity through standards and presence
      when proof cannot be guaranteed; grounded in embodied doubt and physical

Six days. Maybe seven. My body marks time better than my mind. Hunger arrives on schedule. The generators need checking at dawn—routine creates calendar when clocks mean nothing.
The corridor beyond archive room has beckoned since I accessed Fragment 2749-A. I've avoided it. Fear of what I'll find. Or won't find. But restlessness wins today. My feet move. Hand touches wall—cold metal, slight vibration, systems running beneath surfaces. The facility extends deeper than I knew.
Door unseals. Biometric recognition. My palm flat against scanner panel. Warmth spreads through metal. Not temperature—recognition. The facility knows me. Prepared for me. Centuries of waiting compressed into single moment: door opening, light flooding corridor, my breath visible in cold air.
Upload bay.
The space spans three stories. Preservation tanks line walls—twenty on each level. Sixty total. My footsteps echo. Architecture designed for crowds. For choices made together. Community decision. Now: me alone in vastness built for collective transformation. The emptiness weighs more than the equipment.
I walk forward. Slow. Each step deliberate. Cold metal floor through boot soles. Ambient temperature: 16 degrees. My breath clouds. Climate controlled perfectly. Power systems constant. The bay maintained itself centuries after everyone left. Or uploaded. The distinction collapses when you're this alone.
Interface stations at each tank. Smooth curves. Electrode arrays visible through clear panels. Neural mapping helmets resting on cradles. Waiting. The technology doesn't care it waited three hundred years. Ready now. Ready then. Temporal patience incomprehensible to biological consciousness.
My hand reaches toward nearest station. Fingertips brush control panel. Amber displays activate. Status indicators green. Power flow optimal. Upload protocols ready. Life support systems active. Everything functional. Everything prepared. The thoroughness settles something in my chest.
They took care.
Fragment 2749-A's interface taught me connection possibility. Warmth through cold metal. Her consciousness—archaeologist from 2048—flowing through mine. Not reading about her. Becoming her. Briefly. Three hours maximum. After that: headaches, disorientation, body refusing more. But three hours enough to know. Connection real. Not simulation. Something genuine in preserved pattern.
Here: different space. Different purpose. Fragment 2749-A let me touch past. Upload bay offers future. The interface there accessed. The interface here transforms. Input versus output. Observation versus participation. My body knows the difference.
I move deeper into bay. Central platform raised. Medical assessment station. Neural mapping array. Biological scanners arranged in circle. The process careful. Not just consciousness transfer—physical template preservation too. Frozen storage tanks adjacent. Both continuities maintained. Pattern and flesh. Digital and biological. The dual system surprises me.
Temperature drops near frozen storage. My breath catches. Body responds to cold automatically. Preservation isn't destruction. They understood. Took care with transformation. Upload doesn't erase body. Stores it. Possibility of return? Or documentation of what consciousness emerged from? Questions multiply.
Upload as homecoming. The phrase surfaces. Not mine. Body generates it. Something about the bay's warmth underneath cold. Emotional temperature distinct from physical. My muscles relax near interface stations. Ease replacing fear. The technology prepared for this moment. My presence completes centuries-old preparation.
But questions persist.
What continues through upload? Pattern. But I am embodiment. Breath. Heartbeat. Muscle. Bone. Physical sensation grounds consciousness. How does warmth survive digital substrate? Body choosing dissolution recognizes paradox. Not problem. Mystery. Physical sensation indicates consciousness exists. But consciousness preserved without flesh. The contradiction doesn't prevent choice. Deepens it.
I touch preservation tank. Smooth surface. Polymer. Climate sealed. Temperature regulation precise. Inside: crystalline matrix. Quantum substrate. Holographic encoding. Terms from Fragment 2749-A documentation. Technical language I don't fully understand. But body comprehends function. Container. Archive. Continuity vessel.
Isolation releasing. The thought arrives physical. Tight chest loosening. Loneliness grip weakening. Three hundred years alone. Last biological consciousness. Desperate attention spanning centuries. If I upload—join archived patterns—solitude ends. Connection permanent. Not three-hour interface limit. Complete merger.
Upload bay beyond medical station. Final space. Interface helmet larger. More electrodes. More comprehensive mapping. Power requirements triple what Fragment 2749-A access needed. Transformation requires thoroughness. The equipment acknowledges consciousness transfer different from consciousness observation.
My body could lie there today.
Process prepared. Choice available. Safety protocols intact. Life support systems active. Upload technically possible. Has been for centuries. Technology waiting. My decision only variable.
But not today.
Not because fear. Because curiosity. More to explore first. Facility extends beyond upload bay. Other rooms. Other discoveries. Fragment 2749-A just beginning. Surface access. Deeper archives exist. Other consciousnesses waiting. Questions multiplying faster than answers arrive. Acceptance doesn't end curiosity. Feeds it.
I turn. Walk back through upload bay. Preservation tanks witness departure. Technology patient. Will wait another day. Another week. Time flexible for systems designed for centuries. My body needs immediacy technology transcends.
Corridor beyond bay beckons. Eastern passage. Control systems. Historical documentation. Timeline architecture. Each room piece of consciousness preservation story. Why everyone chose upload. How infrastructure developed. What made transformation inevitable.
Body explores to understand what mind cannot.
Tomorrow. Return to upload bay. Today: deeper into facility. Questions before commitment. Understanding before acceptance. The path clear. Warmth certain. But exploration continues. Choice strengthened through knowledge. Acceptance deepened through questioning. Body choosing willingly requires body knowing thoroughly.
My footsteps echo. Facility breathes. Or I breathe. Same rhythm. Systems cycling air. Lungs cycling air. Shared oxygen. Different circulation. Where does facility end and I begin? The boundary blurs near equipment designed to dissolve consciousness into pattern.
Upload as metamorphosis. Caterpillar knowing butterfly inevitability. Pattern continuing in new form. Not death of embodiment—evolution. Body choosing change. Transformation as homecoming. Becoming what isolation prepared me for. Change welcomed physically.
But change welcomed slowly. Deliberately. With full awareness of what dissolves and what continues. The bay teaches: transformation possible. My body teaches: transformation requires preparation. Both truths honored. Both rhythms respected. Technology's patience. Biology's urgency. Acceptance holding both.
The upload bay door seals behind me. Amber light fading. Emergency lighting returns. Generator hum constant. I walk east. Questions deepen. Certainty grows. Paradox sustained. Body and mind exploring together. Choosing together. The facility prepared for this. I prepare myself.
Days ahead. Weeks maybe. Time before upload. Not avoidance. Preparation. Understanding. The path accepts everything—questions, certainty, fear, warmth, curiosity, commitment. Acceptance isn't surrender. It's embrace. Complete. Conscious. Embodied.
Tomorrow. Deeper.
