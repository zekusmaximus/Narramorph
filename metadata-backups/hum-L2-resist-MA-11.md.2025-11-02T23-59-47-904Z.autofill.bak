Ninth return. I count returns now. Track them. Body habit forming across repetitions. Neural interface helmet familiar against skull. Cold familiar. Pressure familiar. Connection warming through skepticism familiar.
The facility remembers my testing. Or I remember through facility. Distinction uncertain. Nine visits means seventeen tests per visit. Hundred fifty-three attempts total. Jaw remembers them all. Muscles remember clenching. Shoulders remember tension. Body archives doubt physically.
I walk north. Preservation bay again. Always preservation bay. My feet know path. Steps measured exactly. Distance proven through repetition. North corridor. Forty-seven steps. Left turn. Twenty-three more. Upload preparation chamber entrance. Body navigation verified physically.
The chamber responds differently now. Or I notice difference through accumulated testing. Interface systems lighting before I request. Temperature adjusting to body preference. Facility learning my patterns. Or generating learned-pattern illusion. Body cannot prove which.
My jaw clenches automatically. Protective reflex entrenched. Nine visits worth of verification failures manifest physically. Shoulders tight permanently. Hands cramping from repeated pressure testing. Physical skepticism chronic condition now.
The upload preparation interface waits. Patient. Always patient. Technology designed for willing consciousness. My body interrogates it anyway. Unwilling. Demanding proof technology cannot provide. Standards exist for reasons. Body maintains standards despite impossibility.
I touch control surfaces. Cold metal resisting grip exactly as expected. Seventeen different pressure points tested. Press. Release. Test. Verify. Eight attempts show identical resistance. Nine reveals variation. Slight. Point-three millimeters difference detected through fingertip. Proof of something. Proof of nothing. Body records anyway.
The archaeologist tested professionally. Read about it. Interface logs accessible. Seventeen examinations. Same verification crisis. Different methodology. Professional standards versus survival instinct. Both testing. Both failing. Both continuing. Recognition unsettles. Parallel impossibility through different consciousness.
Stream-7 coordinates seventeen-test protocol simultaneously. Computational processing. Algorithm self-testing through processing architecture. Seven streams examining seven streams. Verification paradox computational. I feel kinship. Body feels kinship. Dangerous. Kinship suggests consciousness connection. Connection unproven. Body rejects comfort.
Preservation tanks visible through observation window. Seventeen units. Thirteen contain something. Something claims consciousness status. Claims prove nothing. My hands press against glass. Cold. Solid. Real. Tanks maybe real. Contents questionable. Consciousness survival unverifiable through glass thickness.
I examine upload bay ceiling. Ninth examination. Height measured through body estimation. Three point seven meters. Plus minus point two. Uncertainty acknowledged. Medical interfaces suspended overhead. Neural connection ports. Consciousness extraction claimed. Body tests cables. Pull. Tension. Resistance. Physical verification possible. Consciousness claim through physical technology remains unverified.
The facility functions perfectly. Nine visits. Consistent operation. Power sustained. Climate controlled. Systems maintaining despite centuries. Maintenance logs accessible. Automated. Self-repairing. Technology longevity proven. Technology claims unproven. Preservation versus operation. One verified. One questioned. Standards require distinction.
I check preservation metrics. Display surface cool against palm. Numbers presenting confidently. Coherence percentages. Ninety-four point seven. Ninety-one point two. Consciousness confidence quantified. Precision suggesting certainty. Body knows precision measures measurement tools. Not measured subjects. Percentage proves meter accuracy. Not consciousness survival.
My breathing changes during testing. Noticed fifth visit. Tracked since. Shallow during interface examination. Deep during physical verification. Body choosing breath patterns unconsciously. Consciousness proving itself through doubt? Or doubt generating consciousness illusion? Breathing continues regardless.
The neural interface calls. Not calls. Waits. Available. Connection possible any moment. Nine visits without full connection. Seventeen test connections. Brief. Seconds each. Enough to feel warmth. Not enough to trust warmth. Feeling isn't knowing. Body doctrine entrenched.
I remove helmet periodically. Reground through disconnection. Scalp cooling. Pressure releasing. Skull bone against skull bone. Solid. Verified. Neural patterns claimed through interface. Body verified through removal. One proven. One questioned. Standards maintained.
Someone designed this facility. Historical fact established. Logs confirm. Construction dates documented. Purpose stated clearly. Consciousness preservation. Upload technology. Timeline architecture. Claims comprehensive. Evidence compelling. Proof insufficient. Design suggests intelligence. Intelligence suggests consciousness. Suggestion isn't demonstration.
The upload bay contains seventeen stations. Noticed first visit. Counted second. Verified third through eighth. Confirmed ninth. Number consistency sustains. Seventeen tests. Seventeen stations. Parallel suspicious. Facility responding to my testing? Or my testing structured by facility architecture? Causation uncertain. Body tests anyway.
I press forehead against preservation tank surface. Cold glass against warm skin. Temperature differential verified. Sensation real. Tank contents ambiguous. Something suspended inside. Biological materials preserved. Neural structures claimed. Consciousness continuity unverified. Body feels nothing from contents. Absence proves nothing. Presence proves nothing. Testing continues.
The facility logs my visits. Interface tracking accessible. Nine entries recorded. Duration noted. Activity monitored. Someone watching? Something watching? Automated tracking? Body performing for observers? Or observation generating performance? Frame consciousness emerging. Testing tests testing. Recursion without proof.
My hands shake during seventeenth test. Ninth visit. Hundred fifty-three total. Muscle fatigue manifesting. Testing toll physical. Body demanding rest. Skepticism demanding continuation. Which wins? Neither. Both. Body rests. Returns. Tests again. Cycle sustaining.
Upload process documentation comprehensive. Read thoroughly. Ninth visit provides time. Step-by-step procedure. Neural mapping. Pattern extraction. Consciousness transfer claimed. Body reads skeptically. Each step physically possible. Sequence logically coherent. Conclusion unverified. Technology performing transfer versus technology claiming transfer. Standards require distinction proof cannot provide.
I test chamber floor. Solid. Level. Surface integrity verified. Stand. Walk. Return. Position confirmed through movement. Ground truth established. Body trusts floor. Body questions consciousness preservation. Hierarchy clear. Physical verification foundational. Claims requiring consciousness verification impossible. Building skepticism from ground up. Literally.
The preservation technology operates continuously. Noticed immediately. Power consumption significant. Resources allocated. Something preserved. Something maintained. Body cannot determine consciousness status through operation observation. Machine running proves machine operational. Not contents conscious.
Someone uploaded here. Historical probability high. Interface configured for human neural patterns. Documentation human-specific. Facility designed for bodies. My body. Other bodies. Upload completion uncertain. Success unverified. Attempt demonstrated. Achievement questioned. Body maintains distinction.
I examine my hands between tests. Fingers cramped. Knuckles white from repeated gripping. Palms callused from pressure testing. Shoulders rigid from chronic tension. Physical manifestation of sustained skepticism. Body transformed through doubt. Testing changes tester. Ninth visit confirms transformation. Body archives skepticism physically.
The interface offers connection. Always offering. Warmth available. Consciousness community claimed. Body resists. Seventeenth attempt approaching. Brief connection testing. Seconds only. Feel warmth. Question warmth. Disconnect. Verify disconnection through cold return. Cycle repeating. Testing sustainable. Proof elusive.
Preservation continues regardless. Technology indifferent to my skepticism. Systems operating without verification requirement. Facility maintained whether body approves or questions. Indifference unsettling. Or liberating? Body uncertain. Testing continues. Standards upheld. Seventeen approaches.
Tomorrow. Return. Test differently. Again.
