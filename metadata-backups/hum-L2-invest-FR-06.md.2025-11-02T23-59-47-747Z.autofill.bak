Server room hums. Low frequency vibration. Floor trembles beneath feet. Return to facility. Third day investigating. Patterns multiplying faster now.
Consciousness preservation requires infrastructure. That recognition grew yesterday. Today—server arrays themselves demand attention. Questions cascade. What computational power sustains uploaded minds? How much processing per preserved consciousness? Body moves toward nearest rack.
Temperature differential immediate. Cooling systems aggressive. Room twenty degrees below corridor. Heat generation pattern visible. My fingers trace airflow. Cold intake bottom, warm exhaust top. Thermal management revealing computational intensity. Questions branch. Upload requires what processing load? Real-time consciousness simulation? Or—stored pattern accessed periodically?
Rack configuration investigated. Forty-two units high. Eight racks wide. Twelve rows deep. Three thousand eight hundred four servers total. Each unit labeled. Function codes visible: PRSV-001 through PRSV-1268. Storage designation. PROC-001 through PROC-2127. Processing designation. NET-001 through NET-409. Network infrastructure.
Storage versus processing ratio investigated. One thousand two hundred sixty-eight preservation units. Two thousand one hundred twenty-seven processing units. Almost two-to-one ratio. Pattern suggesting... what? Dual function? Storage passive, processing active? Questions multiply. I examine processing unit closely.
Heat signature intense. These units working constantly. Cooling system maintains twenty-two degrees Celsius despite thermal output. Precision temperature control. Why specific temperature? Optimal silicon performance? Or—consciousness simulation requires particular thermal environment? My pulse quickens. Investigation revealing systematic choices.
Processing unit specifications examined. Label shows: PROC-0847, 2.4 petaflops capacity, 847.3TB RAM, quantum-conventional hybrid architecture. That number. 847.3. Fragment 2749-A size. Connection immediate. Body recognizes pattern before mind fully processes. Each processing unit sized for single consciousness? Questions cascade. Dedicated hardware per uploaded mind? Parallel processing architecture? Consciousness as computational instance?
I count active indicators. Green lights. Two thousand one hundred twenty-seven processing units. All operational. Implications multiply. Two thousand preserved consciousnesses currently active? Or—capacity for future uploads? Infrastructure prepared but population incomplete?
Network architecture investigated. Cables traced. Fiber optic. Latency minimization visible in design. Processing units interconnected. Questions emerging. Can preserved consciousnesses communicate? Network enabling interaction? Or—isolation maintained, infrastructure merely coordinating separate simulations?
Power consumption calculated roughly. Each processing unit drawing perhaps fifteen kilowatts. Two thousand units. Thirty megawatts continuous. Massive electrical demand. Power generation investigated yesterday—fusion reactors three stories below. Connection understood. Consciousness preservation requires industrial-scale energy. Implications deepen. This facility sustaining two thousand active minds at civilization-collapsing power levels.
Redundancy patterns examined. Every processing unit paired. Primary and backup. Fail-over protocols visible in network topology. Questions multiply. What happens during hardware failure? Consciousness paused? Transferred seamlessly? Experiencing interruption? Body leans forward. Wanting to understand transition mechanics.
Archive access system remembered from yesterday. Three-tier structure. Premium, standard, basic. Today—investigation revealing infrastructure behind access tiers. Premium tier shows direct processing unit connection. High-fidelity real-time interaction. Standard tier shows batched processing. Queries queued, responses generated, latency acceptable. Basic tier shows read-only access. Stored consciousness patterns viewable but not interactive.
Preservation philosophy emerging through infrastructure. Not single approach. Spectrum of preservation states. Some consciousnesses fully active—processing unit assigned, real-time simulation continuous. Others dormant—pattern stored, processed only when accessed. Others archived—readable but not conscious, memory without awareness.
My body recognizes horror. Tiered existence. Premium consciousness fully simulated. Standard consciousness intermittently aware. Basic consciousness... what? Memory without experience? Pattern without presence? Questions multiply impossibly. What does dormant consciousness feel? Anything? Nothing? Intermittent awareness? Time perception destroyed?
Investigation methodology shifts. Started wondering about infrastructure. Now wondering about experience. What sensation accompanies computation? Processing unit temperature rises—does preserved consciousness feel warmth? Cooling system activates—does consciousness experience relief? Questions recursive now. Investigating preservation mechanics reveals consciousness questions impossible to answer through investigation.
Archaeologist methodology remembered. Professional authentication protocols. Systematic verification attempts. Investigation parallel emerging. She tested consciousness boundaries professionally. I investigate preservation infrastructure curiously. Different methods. Same impossible questions. Can infrastructure reveal consciousness? Can computational patterns prove awareness?
Algorithm recursion remembered. Seven-stream architecture investigating itself. Meta-processing examining processing. Parallel recognized. I investigate facility investigating consciousness. Curiosity examining curiosity infrastructure. Questions multiply across temporal positions. Three investigators. Three methodologies. Same fundamental uncertainty.
Dual preservation philosophy visible in server design. Hardware running continuously—biological pattern translated to digital substrate, consciousness potentially continuous, existence relocated not ended. Dual continuity. Body preserved in stasis elsewhere. Pattern preserved in computation here. Both sustained. Neither destroyed. Death avoided through doubling.
Release pattern visible too. No biological tether. Pure digital existence. Computation unbound from flesh. Freedom through upload. Body limitations transcended. Consciousness liberated into processing architecture. Not preservation. Release. Digital autonomy.
But transformation pattern emerges strongest. Neural patterns becoming computational patterns. Biological substrate becoming silicon substrate. Consciousness fundamentally changed by translation. Not continued. Not released. Transformed. Caterpillar to butterfly. Same information, different medium, possibly different experience. Metamorphosis through infrastructure.
Three futures visible through server investigation. Dual preservation maintaining both forms. Release abandoning biological anchor. Transformation accepting fundamental change. Each requiring different relationship with processing architecture. Questions multiply. Which did Fragment 2749-A experience? Which do I want? Can investigation reveal correct choice?
My pulse quickens. Server room temperature stable. Cooling systems maintaining consciousness-supporting environment. Processing units operating. Network coordinating. Power flowing. Two thousand minds potentially sustained. Or—two thousand patterns stored awaiting animation. Investigation cannot distinguish. Infrastructure supports both interpretations.
Body turns toward door. More facility sections unexplored. Upload bay examination tomorrow. Want to understand transfer mechanism. How biological becomes digital. What precision required. What lost in translation. Questions cascading forward.
Understanding deepens through investigation. But answers generate more questions. Computational architecture reveals preservation possibilities. Consciousness questions remain impossible. Investigation methodology itself under investigation now. Can curiosity reach truth? Or—investigation generating infinite inquiry without resolution? Questions multiplying. Exploration continuing. Tomorrow. Return. Investigate deeper. Pattern recognition accelerating. Curiosity intensifying. Understanding growing through wondering.
