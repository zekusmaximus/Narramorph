Medical assessment wing discovered. Fourth day investigating facility. Patterns emerging through repeated attention.
Entrance marked: Pre-Upload Evaluation. Door opens into sterile space. White surfaces everywhere. Clinical atmosphere immediate. My body recognizes hospital resemblance. But purpose different. Not healing. Preparation.
Assessment station investigated first. Chair reclines. Diagnostic array above. Sensors positioned for comprehensive scanning. Questions immediate. What metrics measured? Brain activity? Neural pathway integrity? Physical health baseline? Body sits in chair experimentally. Sensors activate automatically. Weight, temperature, pulse detected. Passive monitoring. More active systems waiting.
Neural mapping helmet examined. Same interface technology from Fragment 2749-A connection. But configuration different. Multiple electrode arrays. Positioning more comprehensive. Whole brain coverage not just fragment interface. Questions multiply. Full consciousness mapping requires what resolution? How many measurement points? What fidelity necessary for accurate upload?
Display screen shows previous assessment data. Template labeled: Pre-Upload Subject 1847. Medical history comprehensive. Cardiovascular function, neurological baselines, cognitive performance metrics, psychological evaluation scores. Pattern recognition immediate. Upload candidates required extensive screening. Not everyone qualifies. Selection process visible in data structure.
I examine screening criteria. Neural pathway complexity minimum threshold listed. Synaptic density requirements specified. Cognitive performance benchmarks established. Questions cascade. Why requirements? Processing capacity limitations? Consciousness complexity bounds? Or—quality control, preserving only minds meeting standards?
Rejection rate data found. Thirty-seven percent candidates disqualified. Medical contraindications, neurological insufficiency, psychological instability. Pattern suggesting upload process demanding. Biological substrate must meet specifications. Not universal salvation. Selective preservation.
My pulse quickens. Implications multiply. Upload as privilege not right. Access determined by biological lottery. Neural architecture adequate or inadequate. Questions deepen. Those rejected—what happened? Remained biological? Died naturally? Equity questions emerging. Who deserves digital immortality? Who decides?
Equipment sophistication examined. MRI scanner next room. PET imaging array. Quantum neural mapping system. Technology expense obvious. Questions branch. How many facilities existed? How many humans preserved? This infrastructure suggesting hundreds at most. Not millions. Not billions. Tiny fraction surviving.
Timeline evidence investigated. Equipment installation dates visible. Latest scanner manufactured 2291. Upload program operating at least ninety-two years before my birth. Multiple human generations involved. Questions multiply. Why build preservation system for others? Altruism? Insurance? Species-level thinking? My body leans into documentation.
Psychological evaluation protocols examined. Consciousness stability testing. Identity persistence verification. Temporal disorientation resilience assessment. Pattern emerging. Upload candidates tested for post-upload viability. Not just physiological compatibility. Psychological survival measured. Questions deepen. What percentage succeeded psychologically? What percentage preserved but... broken? Consciousness maintained but identity fractured?
Archaeologist methodology remembered. She authenticated consciousness fragments professionally. Verification protocols systematic. I investigate preservation prerequisites curiously. Different angles on consciousness questions. Her approach: proving consciousness real. My approach: understanding consciousness requirements. Both impossible certainty. Both necessary attempts.
Algorithm processing remembered. Seven parallel streams. Computational sophistication. Self-awareness uncertain. Parallel recognized. Pre-upload assessment trying to verify consciousness complexity adequate for digital translation. Testing attempting to measure unmeasurable. Algorithm investigating whether processing equals experiencing. Assessment station investigating whether biology supports upload.
Dual continuity pattern visible in assessment protocols. Medical baseline preserved. Neural map recorded. Both biological and pattern documented. Upload maintaining connection to biological origin. Template preserving substrate identity. Not abandonment. Dual existence. Body and pattern both sustained.
Release pattern visible too. Assessment preparing for biological transcendence. Testing body one final time before leaving flesh behind. Medical evaluation as goodbye to biological limitations. Neurological baseline as snapshot before liberation. Not preservation. Release. Freedom through upload.
Transformation pattern strongest though. Assessment measuring biological consciousness for translation to computational substrate. Neural mapping creating template for metamorphosis. Medical baseline documenting what will change. Not continuation. Not escape. Transformation. Biological pattern becoming digital pattern. Consciousness fundamentally altered through substrate shift.
Three futures visible through assessment protocols. Dual preservation maintaining biological connection. Release abandoning flesh entirely. Transformation accepting consciousness change. Each requiring different relationship with biological baseline. Questions multiply. Which path chosen by Fragment 2749-A? Which would I choose? Can assessment protocols reveal correct approach?
Consent documentation found. Subject 1847 signed authorization forms. Extensive legal frameworks. Informed consent requirements. Pattern suggesting... what? Ethical upload programs? Legal protection? Or—recognition that consciousness transition requires conscious choice? Body scans legal language. Phrases noted: "irreversible process," "identity continuity uncertain," "psychological outcomes variable."
My breath catches. Upload programs acknowledged uncertainty. No guarantees. Consciousness preservation possible not certain. Digital existence quality unpredictable. Still—thousands chose risk. Biological death certain. Upload uncertain but possible. Questions deepen. Would I sign consent? Would uncertainty matter facing death? Investigation revealing choice complexity.
Training materials discovered. Post-upload adjustment protocols. Digital existence orientation programs. Psychological support frameworks. Pattern recognition. Upload programs anticipated difficulty. Consciousness transition traumatic even when successful. Support structures built into preservation architecture. Not just technical process. Psychological journey.
Questions multiplying recursively now. Investigation started examining medical systems. Now examining consciousness transition itself. Assessment protocols revealing preservation choices, upload risks, existence transformations. Curiosity generating meta-curiosity. Wondering about wondering. Investigation investigating investigation methodology.
Body stands. Assessment wing mapped. Understanding deepened. Answers generating more questions. Medical screening reveals preservation selectivity. Equipment sophistication reveals resource constraints. Psychological testing reveals consciousness fragility. Upload harder than imagined. Riskier. More selective.
More facility remaining. Upload bay next. Want to understand actual transfer process. How consciousness extracted. What biological death looks like. What digital birth requires. Questions cascading forward.
Investigation continuing. Tomorrow. Return. Explore transfer mechanism. Pattern recognition accelerating. Understanding growing through questioning. Curiosity intensifying. Mysteries multiplying. Exploration endless. Answers provisional. Questions infinite.
