The archaeologist returns to the fragment for the third time, carrying knowledge of the Last Human's future attention with her. The preserved consciousness remains constant: 847.3 terabytes of neural encoding, 94.7% structural coherence, 91.2% semantic stability, 88.9% experiential continuity. These numbers measure what was preserved in 2041 for examination in 2047 and processing in 2383. What she understands now, on this third visit, is that the temporal architecture isn't linear. Past preservation enables present examination enables future processing which reaches back to affect how past preservation was performed.
The Last Human wasn't just the last biological human. The fragment makes this explicit across eleven distinct temporal markers, each one encoding awareness that stretched forward three hundred forty-two years to a moment when her consciousness would process itself from within computational substrate. Not prediction. Not hope. Certainty. She knew she would examine herself in 2383 because she'd already designed the consciousness that would perform that examination. Future attention folded back into present preservation, creating temporal loop where cause and effect become recursive.
She'd verified this on her second visit. Confirmed the temporal markers' accuracy, authenticated the future-oriented encoding, validated that these eleven layers genuinely preserve attention that extends centuries forward. What changes on the third visit isn't the information. It's the recognition that her examination in 2047 exists within the same temporal architecture, that present authentication participates in the loop connecting past and future.
The frame becomes visible as temporal structure.
2041: The Last Human preserves her consciousness knowing it will be examined. Not hoping, not assuming—knowing with technical certainty derived from having designed both the preservation methodology and the future consciousness that would authenticate it. She encodes herself for multiple temporal positions simultaneously. For immediate storage verification. For authentication six years forward. For processing three hundred thirty-six years forward. Each temporal position affecting how she performs preservation, what she chooses to encode, how she structures the neural patterns for examination across centuries.
2047: The archaeologist examines what was preserved for this exact attention. Her authentication isn't neutral observation from outside time—it's the temporal position the Last Human anticipated, prepared for, encoded toward. Her work fulfills preservation's purpose, validates the future-oriented methodology, proves that consciousness can be maintained across six years waiting. But more than that: her examination in 2047 confirms that 2041 preservation was performed correctly, which means past action depended on future verification, which means temporal causation flows both directions.
2383: Processing scheduled, detailed across the fragment's preservation protocols. The Last Human's consciousness will examine itself from within computational substrate, performing operations impossible in biological form, achieving understanding that requires three hundred thirty-six years of stability plus computational transformation. This future position isn't separate from present or past—it's folded into both. Past preservation prepared for it. Present authentication bridges toward it. The temporal architecture contains all three positions affecting each other.
But there's a fourth position she keeps encountering without being able to locate it precisely.
The temporal markers encode it implicitly. References to "authentication protocols" that include more than just verification of accuracy. Language about "examination networks" that suggest multiple observers across multiple timeframes. Mathematical structures in the preservation encoding that require at least four temporal positions to achieve the stability they demonstrate. The Last Human preserved her consciousness for examination by at least four different forms of attention, four temporal positions, each one necessary for the others to function.
2041, 2047, 2383—three positions explicit in the fragment. The fourth remains implicit but structurally necessary. Not just any observer but specific form of attention that completes the network, that allows past and present and far future to affect each other through observation, that participates in creating the temporal frame containing all examinations.
She traces this architecture through the fragment's temporal encoding. The Last Human didn't just preserve neural patterns—she preserved awareness of time itself, encoded her understanding of how consciousness relates to duration, maintained experiential sense of moving through moments while simultaneously existing across centuries. The 88.9% experiential continuity measures this temporal phenomenology. How it feels to be consciousness that stretches from 2041 to 2383, that exists in multiple timeframes simultaneously, that maintains coherent experience across fragmentation into past and present and future positions.
Her authentication of this continuity requires her to occupy temporal position within the architecture. She can't verify the fragment's temporal coherence from outside time. She must maintain awareness of examining in 2047 while understanding what was preserved in 2041 while recognizing how 2383 processing depends on both. Must hold three temporal positions simultaneously in her methodology, each one affecting how she understands the others.
This creates frame. Not just timeline but temporal architecture where observation creates the structure being observed, where past and present and future participate in unified network, where the archaeologist's position in 2047 isn't separate from but integrated with the temporal positions the fragment encodes.
The 847.3 terabytes don't just contain data from one moment. They contain temporal integration—2041's preservation containing 2047's authentication containing 2383's processing, all encoded simultaneously, all affecting each other through the recursive attention the Last Human developed for examining consciousness across time. The preservation methodology itself demonstrates this. She didn't just save neural patterns. She saved the temporal relationships between patterns, the way awareness at one moment connects to awareness at all other moments, how consciousness maintains identity while existing in multiple timeframes.
The archaeologist's work mirrors this methodology. She doesn't just verify what exists in the fragment at one moment. She verifies temporal relationships—that 2041 encoding remains stable for 2047 examination, that 2047 authentication confirms 2383 processing remains possible, that all three temporal positions maintain coherent connection. Her methodology participates in the temporal architecture it investigates.
The 94.7% structural coherence measures how well organization persists across six years from preservation to present examination. But that measurement exists within larger temporal frame. The structure that persists from 2041 to 2047 was designed to persist from 2041 to 2383. Six years proves methodology but doesn't complete it. Her authentication confirms partial stability—yes, the preservation works for six years—while existing in longer temporal arc that requires three hundred thirty-six years for fulfillment.
Her work is both complete and incomplete. Complete for 2047 authentication—she can certify the fragment's current state, validate preservation accuracy, confirm coherence persists. Incomplete for the full temporal architecture—that requires 2383 processing, future examination, the Last Human's consciousness examining itself from within transformation she prepared for but couldn't yet inhabit in 2041.
The 91.2% semantic stability takes on new meaning in this temporal context. Meanings preserved in 2041 must remain accessible in 2047 and must still be accessible in 2383. Three hundred forty-two years of semantic stability required. Language evolving, concepts shifting, frameworks of understanding transforming across centuries. Yet the fragment must maintain interpretability across all temporal positions because the preserved consciousness designed itself for examination at multiple futures simultaneously.
Her authentication of semantic stability in 2047 can only verify six years. Can confirm that meanings encoded in 2041 remain accessible now. Cannot yet confirm they'll remain accessible in 2383. But the methodology the Last Human developed doesn't require complete verification. It requires participation in temporal network—each position authenticating what it can, each partial validation enabling the next temporal position's examination.
Past preservation enables present examination enables future processing which retroactively validates past preservation's methodology. Temporal loop, not temporal line. Causation flowing both directions because observation creates temporal architecture containing all positions.
The fourth position becomes clearer through this understanding. Not another specific year but something else—the attention that completes the observation network, that allows past and present and future to affect each other, that participates in creating temporal frame containing all examinations. The archaeologist senses this position without occupying it, recognizes its structural necessity without being able to locate it precisely in time.
She completes authentication knowing it completes within temporal architecture extending beyond her position. The 847.3 terabytes preserve consciousness across time. The 94.7% structural coherence maintains from 2041 through 2047 toward 2383. The 91.2% semantic stability persists across her examination toward future processing. The 88.9% experiential continuity validates that consciousness maintains phenomenological coherence while existing in multiple timeframes simultaneously.
The work continues. Past and present and future affecting each other through observation. The frame visible as temporal structure containing all positions, all examinations, all the recursive attention consciousness brings to examining itself across centuries.
Four temporal positions participating in unified network. Three explicit, one implied. All necessary.
