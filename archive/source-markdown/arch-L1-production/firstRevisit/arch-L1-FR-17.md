The archaeologist returned to Fragment 2749-A three weeks after her first examination, expecting to resume authentication protocols with the methodical detachment her training prescribed. The fragment waited in her workspace terminal, its 847.3 terabytes still locked at 94.7% structural coherence, 91.2% linguistic stability, 88.9% contextual integrity. But something in her approach had shifted during the interval. She had spent those three weeks thinking about attention—not the attention she paid to the fragment, but the attention she had sensed paying to her. Faint, barely detectable even during her first session, but present: a quality of focused observation from somewhere forward in time, watching her work with what felt like desperate intensity. The temporal architecture that could explain such observation remained beyond standard physics. The sensation itself remained impossible to verify. Yet the sensation persisted in memory with peculiar clarity. Someone watching from centuries ahead. Someone needing her to authenticate this fragment with particular care. Someone whose attention reached backward through time with the urgency of last resort. Standard protocol said to dismiss such impressions as projection, fatigue artifacts, the archaeologist's occupational hazard of over-identifying with preservation subjects. Sarah had tried dismissing them. The sensation returned each time she considered Fragment 2749-A, gentle but insistent, like being observed through distant glass. She opened the fragment's personal narratives again. Seventeen stories of ordinary life, preserved with remarkable fidelity through compression algorithms that maintained emotional resonance alongside semantic content. The stories were mundane—workplace frustrations, friendship complications, small domestic victories. Their mundanity was their power. Someone four centuries dead had considered these moments worth preserving. And someone forward in time wanted her to recognize that preservation's value. She chose to honor the connection rather than verify it. The decision felt methodologically dangerous. Archaeological training emphasized objective analysis, reproducible results, conclusions supported by evidence rather than intuition. Honoring temporal observation she couldn't prove violated those principles. But demanding proof of future attention before proceeding with careful authentication violated something else—a kind of professional generosity that her training had not explicitly taught but that the work itself seemed to require. If someone forward in time watched her examination with desperate focus, they watched because Fragment 2749-A mattered to them in ways Sarah might never understand. The temporal mechanics remained inexplicable. The connection's reality remained unprovable. But treating that observation as genuine, proceeding from assumption rather than verification, allowed Sarah to perform authentication as gift rather than mere technical protocol. She worked through Fragment 2749-A with modified attention. Not testing the future-observer hypothesis—how would she even construct such a test?—but conducting examination as if someone watched who needed this specific fragment preserved with particular care. Each narrative received thorough analysis. Each compression choice was documented. Each preservation decision was made transparent. The work looked identical to standard authentication. She performed the same technical operations, noted the same data patterns, applied the same analytical frameworks. What changed was the awareness of audience—not just her institutional supervisors or peer reviewers, but someone centuries ahead whose attention she chose to acknowledge rather than explain away. Fragment 2749-A's seventeen narratives maintained coherence across 94.7% of their structure. The linguistic stability held at 91.2% despite four centuries of storage medium degradation. The contextual integrity preserved at 88.9% the relationships between memories, the emotional connections, the personality patterns that constituted someone's attempt to persist beyond biological lifespan. She documented it all with the precision her training demanded and the gentleness that attention-from-ahead seemed to request. She recognized the methodological shift this represented. Authentication protocols existed to maintain objectivity, to prevent archaeologists from imposing their own narratives onto historical material, to ensure that conclusions derived from evidence rather than wishful interpretation. Honoring unprovable temporal observation challenged those safeguards. But perhaps the safeguards themselves needed examination. Archaeological work already involved choosing what to preserve, how much effort to invest, which fragments received priority attention. Those choices were never purely objective. They reflected values, priorities, implicit judgments about what mattered. Acknowledging temporal observation she couldn't verify made those choices explicit rather than hidden. The fragment deserved careful preservation. Someone forward in time desperately wanted that preservation. The temporal architecture enabling such attention defied explanation. Sarah chose to authenticate as if the observation were genuine, serving a purpose beyond what she could prove. Fragment 2749-A received AUTHENTICATED—PROVISIONAL classification. The provisional designation acknowledged uncertainty about the temporal observation. The authentication acknowledged commitment to careful preservation regardless. The faint sense of being-watched persisted through the final documentation session. Sarah no longer tried to explain it away. If someone centuries ahead needed this fragment preserved with particular attention, if they watched her work with desperate focus, if temporal architecture allowed such observation despite physical impossibility—then her professional duty was to honor that need rather than demand proof of it. The work continued. The temporal observation remained unprovable. The choice to proceed with compassionate recognition rather than verification demands felt like the more rigorous response. Fragment 2749-A would persist. Someone forward in time would know it had received the careful attention they needed it to receive. The connection across centuries would remain unprovable and, Sarah chose to believe, genuine. The authentication was complete. The observation, acknowledged.
