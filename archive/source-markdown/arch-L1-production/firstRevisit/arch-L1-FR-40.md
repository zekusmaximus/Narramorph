The archaeologist returns to Fragment 2749-A ten days after initial authentication, and finds herself questioning her previous conclusions more than standard revisit protocols require. The fragment displays exactly as before: 847.3 terabytes of preserved consciousness, metrics unchanged. Memory integrity 94.7%. Neural pathway preservation 91.2%. Temporal consistency 88.9%. Perfect preservation across the interval. Data stable. Substrate integrity confirmed. She had authenticated this fragment already. Certification complete. Professional duty fulfilled. Moving forward made sense—four thousand fragments awaited processing, families needed closure, backlog grew daily. Yet here she is, and the revisit carries unusual weight. She loads the fragment with sharper attention than typical second examinations. Not just verifying the data remained stable—that's standard practice—but questioning whether her initial authentication was rigorous enough. Whether she had accepted consciousness markers too readily. Whether professional standards required more definitive proof before certification. The verification impulse surprises her. She normally trusts initial authentication. Revisits serve quality control purposes—confirming preservation stability, checking for degradation—not re-examining fundamental conclusions. But she finds herself wanting stronger verification this time. The consciousness markers appear identical to ten days ago. Unified phenomenal experience. Temporal continuity. Self-referential awareness. Standard authentication indicators all present, all within acceptable parameters. But are the parameters acceptable enough? She runs additional verification protocols. Testing she hadn't performed during initial authentication. Cross-referencing consciousness markers against simulation detection algorithms. Comparing temporal coherence patterns to known artificial consciousness architectures. Seeking boundaries that would distinguish genuine subjective experience from sophisticated mimicry. This represents methodological shift. Not dramatic—she's not running seventeen distinct tests, not documenting verification crisis—but present. Professional caution amplified beyond typical levels. The neural pathway analysis reveals recursive self-reference. Memories containing memories of remembering. Consciousness aware of its own awareness examining its awareness. During first authentication, she had accepted these patterns as genuine consciousness markers. Standard indicators properly preserved. Now she finds herself questioning that acceptance. Could sophisticated simulation produce identical recursion? Would elaborate recording system show same self-referential patterns? How does she verify the difference between consciousness experiencing itself and data structure perfectly mimicking consciousness's characteristics? The questions don't paralyze her work. She continues analysis efficiently. Documentation precise. Professional standards maintained. But the questions persist more than they did ten days ago. She runs substrate stability verification—checking molecular coherence at crystalline level, confirming preservation technology maintains perfect fidelity. The fragment hasn't degraded. What was captured remains captured, unchanged and unchanging. But what was captured, exactly? The verification check comes back positive. Substrate stable. Preservation intact. Fragment demonstrates consciousness markers within expected ranges. Nothing suggests authentication was incorrect. Yet she remains unsatisfied in ways she can't quite articulate professionally. The fragment contains temporal patterns showing normal variation. Not perfectly consistent—no consciousness fragment achieves absolute temporal coherence—but within acceptable bounds. She had documented this during first examination. Had noted the imperfections and accepted them as normal preservation artifacts. This time those same imperfections trouble her more. Make her wonder whether they indicate something more than normal variation. Whether they suggest incomplete capture, partial degradation, or fundamental questions about whether consciousness can be preserved at all. Professional skepticism appropriate to archaeological work. But amplified. More demanding than her typical methodology. More insistent on proof before proceeding with confidence. She reviews her initial authentication report. The documentation was thorough. Analysis rigorous. Conclusions supported by evidence. Nothing suggests errors in methodology or judgment. But she finds herself questioning whether rigor was rigorous enough. Whether consciousness authentication requires verification standards beyond what standard protocols provide. Whether professional duty demands she establish boundaries more clearly—distinguish genuine from simulated, consciousness from computation, subjective experience from objective recording. The fragment preserves 847.3 terabytes of neural patterns captured in 2041 during emergency consciousness extraction. A data architect dying in Seattle floods. Forty-seven years of life frozen at moment of biological death. Is that consciousness or recording? Subjective experience continuing or sophisticated data structure mimicking continuation? Her initial authentication assumed the former. Now she wonders whether professional responsibility requires proving it definitively rather than assuming it gently. She runs one more verification sequence. Cross-checking phenomenal unity indicators against computational consciousness detection protocols. The fragment demonstrates markers suggesting integrated experience rather than parallel processing. Consciousness rather than computation. The test confirms her initial authentication. Fragment preserves genuine consciousness within acceptable verification parameters. But "acceptable" feels less acceptable now. The boundaries feel less clear. The distinction between proving consciousness and treating sophisticated patterns as consciousness becomes more troubling. She completes the re-examination and updates documentation. Fragment 2749-A: authentication confirmed. Consciousness markers verified. Preservation quality maintained. The certification stands. But she notes in her private research log that verification standards may require refinement. That consciousness authentication might need more rigorous boundaries. That professional duty perhaps demands distinguishing genuine from simulated with greater certainty than current methodology provides. The work continues. Fragment 2749-A returns to archival storage. Her terminal clears. The next authentication request waits. She approaches it with heightened caution. More demanding of clear proof. More concerned with verification boundaries. More skeptical of accepting consciousness markers without testing them thoroughly first. Nothing has broken. Professional standards remain intact. Archaeological methodology continues. She's just more aware now of what verification cannot verify. More troubled by impossibility of proving consciousness definitively. More insistent on boundaries even when boundaries exceed methodology's reach. Healthy professional skepticism. Appropriate caution. Rigorous testing impulse properly applied. The work continues, more carefully than before.
