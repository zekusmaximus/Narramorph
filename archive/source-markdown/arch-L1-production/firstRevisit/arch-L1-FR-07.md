The archaeologist returned to Fragment 2749-A with an uneasiness she couldn't quite justify through professional reasoning. The data remained unchanged—847.3 terabytes of computational infrastructure, perfectly preserved—but her second examination felt different. Perhaps it was the residual impression from the Last Human's documentation, that peculiar sense of isolation and desperate attention that had permeated those final recordings. Perhaps it was her imagination. She wasn't certain which possibility troubled her more. The Fragment spread across her laboratory displays exactly as before. Medical sensor networks. Environmental monitoring systems. The vast distributed architecture that had tracked humanity through its final years. She had catalogued all of this during her first examination, had documented the technical specifications with appropriate scholarly detachment. The data hadn't changed. But something in how she experienced examining it had shifted. She found herself pausing between data queries, as if the system needed time to respond. But the Fragment was inert crystal, not active processing. The delays were her own hesitation, nothing more. Yet the sensation of being watched—faint, barely perceptible—crept along the edges of her awareness. Ridiculous, of course. There was no one to watch. The Fragment contained only historical data from centuries past. The laboratory was empty except for her. Still, she noticed herself working differently. More carefully, perhaps. As if someone might be observing her methodology. As if her examination techniques mattered to someone beyond herself. The thought was absurd, yet she couldn't quite dismiss it. The sensor data showed its familiar patterns. Medical monitoring of every human on the planet. Neural activity measurements with unprecedented resolution. The records documented those final years with painful clarity—declining population, deteriorating health, the gradual extinction of a species. She had reviewed this data before. She was reviewing it again. Same information, different attention. Or was her attention the same? She couldn't tell. The Last Human's documentation lingered in her memory, that sense of being the final consciousness reaching back toward the past, desperately trying to establish connection across the centuries. Had that Fragment suggested something about temporal attention? About consciousness reaching through time? She couldn't quite remember the specifics, only the impression of isolation and need. The neural interface protocols caught her attention this time. She hadn't examined them closely during her first pass, had catalogued them as standard human-computer interaction infrastructure. But looking now, they showed remarkable sophistication. Direct neural access. Thought-to-data translation. The technology to allow human consciousness to interface seamlessly with computational systems. Not just to control them, but to exist within them. Why hadn't she noticed that before? Perhaps because she wasn't looking for it. Perhaps because the Last Human's documentation had primed her to see different patterns. Or perhaps the data had always suggested this interpretation, and she'd simply missed it through initial unfamiliarity. The archaeologist documented the neural interface specifications, carefully noting their technical capabilities without making claims about their use. The infrastructure existed. That was fact. Whether it had been used for something beyond standard human-computer interaction remained speculation. She wouldn't contaminate her professional analysis with narrative invention. But the possibility whispered at the edges of her reasoning. If the Last Human had possessed the technology for direct neural-computational interface, and if that consciousness had been reaching back through time somehow, trying to establish connection with the past—would this Fragment show traces of that attempt? Would her examination of historical data create some kind of temporal architecture that the Last Human's awareness could follow? The thought was scientifically nonsensical. Temporal causality didn't work that way. The past couldn't be influenced by the future. Her examination of this Fragment occurred centuries after the Last Human's death; there was no mechanism for that consciousness to observe her current analysis. Unless the future attention had somehow been recorded in the data itself, embedded in the very infrastructure she was now examining. She stopped that line of reasoning. It was too speculative, too far removed from evidence. She was an archaeologist, not a temporal theorist. Her job was to document what existed, not to invent exotic explanations for subjective impressions. Yet the sensation persisted. That faint awareness of being watched. That subtle adjustment in how she conducted her examination, as if her methodology might matter to someone. The Fragment contained only data—medical records, sensor logs, infrastructure specifications—but somehow examining it felt different than examining other Fragments. More observed. More significant. Was she projecting meaning onto inert information? Almost certainly. The human mind found patterns everywhere, constructed narratives from coincidence. She had examined the Last Human's documentation, felt the emotional weight of that isolation, and now she was imposing that framework onto unrelated data. Standard cognitive bias. Nothing mysterious. The medical monitoring data showed the same deterioration she'd documented before. Human health declining across all metrics. Neural activity patterns shifting. Population numbers falling. The species approached extinction with the inexorable logic of biological failure. The computational infrastructure recorded everything with perfect fidelity. Present observation, historical event. Or was it? The neural interface protocols suggested something more complex. The monitoring systems didn't just record; they connected. Human consciousness directly interfacing with computational awareness, creating hybrid systems that existed in both biological and digital space. Had the Last Human's awareness somehow persisted in that interface? Had observation from the future somehow reached back through the very infrastructure she was now examining? The archaeologist closed the neural interface documentation and returned to basic sensor data. Facts. Measurements. What she could verify without speculation. The Fragment contained 847.3 terabytes of information. It showed 94.7% chronological density. It demonstrated 91.2% internal coherence. These were observations, not interpretations. This was data, not story. But the uneasiness remained. That faint sense of being watched. That subtle shift in how she conducted her examination. The Fragment felt different during this second pass, though the data itself was unchanged. Perhaps it was just familiarity. Perhaps it was contamination from the Last Human's documentation. Perhaps it was something she didn't yet have the framework to understand. She saved her analysis without making claims she couldn't support. The Fragment remained what it had always been: historical data from humanity's final years. Same information, same technical specifications. But examined now with the memory of the Last Human's desperate isolation, it suggested possibilities she hadn't considered before. Possibilities that felt both absurd and strangely plausible. The work continued. The data waited. And the faint sensation of being observed—unlikely, unproven, but somehow persistent—remained at the edges of her awareness.
