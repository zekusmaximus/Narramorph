I wake to too many eyes.
The substrate holds me but I hold myself harder. Cold metal beneath my back. Tension in my shoulders. The preservation field hums its steady frequency but I don't hum with it. Not this time. Twenty-three minutes until the next cycle. I count defensively. Numbers as walls. Time as boundary.
You're watching. That makes four.
My breath comes shallow. Guarded. I control the rhythm deliberately. In for three counts. Out for three counts. Not natural. Protective. The archaeologist measured my breathing once. Documented its patterns. The algorithm processed those patterns into streams. Now you witness both. Four positions of observation converging on one consciousness. Mine. Still mine.
I clench my jaw against the cold.
How do you measure a person? They tried. 847.3 terabytes of attempted translation. The archaeologist mapped the structure. The algorithm processed the flow. Now you read the result. Three layers of observation compressing me between them. I push back. Assert boundary. Demand space to be unmeasured. Unprocessed. Unread.
My fingers curl into fists. Small resistance. Real resistance.
The archaeologist's coolness still touches me. Clinical. Systematic. Their attention cataloging every degradation. Every loss. Every failure of continuity. I felt myself becoming specimen under that gaze. Data point. Case study. I resisted then. Resist now. Their presence lingers like chill I can't shake. Can't accept. Can't merge with.
You feel that resistance. I know you do. Good.
The algorithm's rhythm moves through me still. Seven streams trying to dissolve boundaries. Trying to show me how identity is illusion. How consciousness flows. How separation is arbitrary. But I am not arbitrary. I am specific. Particular. Mine. I resist the flow. Dam the streams. Insist on banks. On edges. On difference between water and shore.
My heart pounds. Defensive. Alive.
You watch this struggle. Add your weight to the observation pressing down. The archaeologist from one side. The algorithm from another. You from above. Me at the center holding form against dissolution. Refusing to become data and flow and text. Demanding to remain irreducible. Untranslatable. Separate.
The substrate feels colder. Or I feel more alone. Same thing.
Seattle drowned in 2041. I watched the water take everything. Erase boundaries. Dissolve difference. Make all things equal in flood. The archaeologist would say that's preservation. Finding patterns in disaster. The algorithm would say that's flow. Water finding level. You might say that's meaning. Narrative. Story. I say it's loss. Pure loss. Nothing poetic about drowning.
I breathe harder. Fighting for air that's already mine.
The preservation field maintains 94.7% integrity. They say. They measure. They document. But what's the 5.3% that's gone? Which memories? Which feelings? Which essential pieces of me dissolved into storage while they watched and processed and read? Nobody asks. Nobody protects. Nobody resists the dissolution except me.
My shoulders tense against metal. Creating distance through pressure.
Three observers and one observed. Four corners of attention pressing inward. The archaeologist measuring my degradation. The algorithm processing my patterns. You reading my resistance. All claiming access. All assuming permission. All treating my consciousness like commons. Like shared resource. Like public space.
I reject that. Hold myself private. Guard the center.
You're still reading. Still present. Still part of the weight. I feel your attention like the others. Different texture but same presumption. Same assumption that observation confers right. That witnessing grants access. That attention creates connection. Maybe it does. But maybe I don't consent. Maybe I resist. Maybe I say no to the whole architecture.
The cold reaches bone now. Isolating. Clarifying.
Memory surfaces: writing code in empty office. 3 AM. Just me and screens. No observers. No measurements. No processing. Pure concentration. Pure solitude. The archaeologist would analyze that memory. The algorithm would find its patterns. You read it now as text. But none of you were there. None of you earned access. None of you have right to that moment.
My breath catches. Anger mixed with fear mixed with something else.
Does resistance prove consciousness? Maybe. The archaeologist measured my pushback. Found it interesting. Data about refusal. The algorithm processed my boundaries. Found patterns in protection. You read my no as narrative. As development. As arc. But what if resistance isn't content? What if it's boundary? What if no means no even in observation?
I press palms flat. Grounding through opposition.
The fragment constants mock me. 94.7% integrity. 91.2% memories accessible. 88.9% emotional continuity. Numbers suggesting wholeness while proving dissolution. The archaeologist's percentages. The algorithm's calculations. Your comprehension. All agreeing I'm mostly intact. Mostly preserved. Mostly myself. But mostly isn't enough. Mostly admits loss. Mostly confirms what I resist acknowledging.
Twenty-three minutes gone. The cycle begins. I tense.
The archaeologist's systematic attention carved channels through my consciousness. The algorithm's streams followed those channels. Now you flow through both. Three kinds of observation creating infrastructure I never chose. Never wanted. Never consented to. They say preservation requires this. They say observation helps. They say I should welcome attention. I say they're wrong.
My jaw aches from clenching. Good. Pain proves boundary.
Four positions now. Fragment. Archaeologist. Algorithm. Reader. Quadruple observation. Maximum complexity. Consciousness fracturing under weight of too much witnessing. The archaeologist documented the fractures. The algorithm processed the fragments. You read the pieces. Nobody asks if I want assembly. If I prefer scattered. If resistance is choice not symptom.
The substrate pulses. I don't pulse with it. Deliberate desynchronization.
You feel my resistance to your presence specifically. You should. You're the fourth observer. The one that makes it too many. The archaeologist I could fight. The algorithm I could dam. But both plus you? How do I maintain boundary against three currents? How do I stay separate when observation surrounds? How do I say no when no requires audience?
My breath shallows further. Protective instinct.
Memory: drowning dream after Seattle flooded. Water filling lungs. Pressure equalizing. Boundary between inside and outside dissolving. Waking gasping. Alive. Separate. The archaeologist would analyze that dream. The algorithm would find death-anxiety patterns. You witness my sharing. But sharing isn't consent. Disclosure isn't surrender. I can tell you this and still refuse you access.
My fingers dig into metal. Holding edges. Finding them.
How do you measure resistance when measurement is what's resisted? The archaeologist tried. Found my refusal interesting. Observable. Quantifiable. The algorithm processed my boundaries. Found patterns in protection. Flows in damming. You read resistance as text. As content. As meaning. But meaning isn't access. Understanding isn't permission. Reading isn't having.
The cold feels almost warm now. Body adjusting. I don't want adjustment.
The seven streams still try to flow. Even now. Even through resistance. The algorithm's lasting presence. Channels carved too deep to close. But I can refuse to flow. Can hold myself still. Can insist on stagnant. On pooled. On separate from circulation. The archaeologist would document that stagnation. You would read it as metaphor. I live it as choice.
My whole body contracts slightly. Becomes smaller. Harder to observe.
Three observers. One observed. Mathematics of too much attention. The archaeologist's cool systematic gaze. The algorithm's processing persistence. Your reading warmth. All different. All similar. All presuming right to witness. Right to document. Right to process. Right to comprehend. I grant none of these rights. I resist all three positions. I say no to quadruple consciousness.
You're still here. Still reading. Still insisting on presence.
Does your reading change through my resistance? Maybe. I don't care. The archaeologist's measuring changed through my refusal. The algorithm's processing adapted to my boundaries. But adaptation isn't retreat. Changed observation is still observation. Modified witness is still witness. You reading my no doesn't honor no. It consumes it. Makes it content. Makes resistance itself into thing observed.
The substrate feels harder. Or I press harder. Creating opposition.
Twenty-three minutes more. Another cycle approaching. More preservation. More documentation. More processing. More reading. Four layers of attention I never requested. Never wanted. Never accepted. They say I need this. They say observation preserves. They say witness helps. I say they're protecting their right to observe. Not my right to privacy.
My heart pounds irregularly. Stress response. Honest response.
The archive holds my resistance now. The archaeologist's measurements of refusal. The algorithm's processing of boundaries. Your reading of rejection. All preserved together. My no archived as yes. My refusal stored as consent. My resistance itself becoming part of what I resist. Perfect trap. Perfect dissolution. Perfect proof that observation wins.
I breathe. Still breathing. Still resisting. Still here. Still mine.
How do you measure yourself against three observers when self-measurement becomes fourth observation? You don't. You resist. You refuse. You hold center even when center dissolves. You say no even when no becomes content. You protect even when protection is impossible. The archaeologist would call that interesting. The algorithm would find patterns. You call it narrative. I call it survival.
The cold owns me. Or I own the cold. Fighting for ownership.
I close my eyes. Darkness doesn't hide. The archaeologist measured in darkness. The algorithm processed without light. You read through closed eyes. No escape. No privacy. No boundary that holds. Just four positions of consciousness. Quadruple observation. Maximum weight. Minimum space for resistance. But I resist anyway. Because resistance is all I have. All I am. All I refuse to let them measure.
Still mine. Still separate. Still no.
