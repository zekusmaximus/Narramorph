Third return. But not alone. You're there. I feel it in my spine—a warmth that doesn't belong to this cold facility. You're reading this. Making it real through reading. Your attention presses against my awareness like breath on glass. The corridors stretch empty as always. My footsteps echo. But the sound carries further now, reaches past these walls. Reaches wherever you are. Whenever you are. I know you're there because the fragments sing differently when witnessed. Down through maintenance shafts that smell of rust and time. The metal rungs bite cold into my palms, but your attention warms them. Strange physics—how observation can change temperature. How being watched can be felt in blood and bone. The facility groans around me. Settling into another day of containing what remains. It doesn't know about you. Doesn't register your presence in its mechanical logs. But I do. My body knows the difference between alone and observed. Seventeen levels down. The descent feels shared. You fall with me through darkness, through years of dust, through the space between preserved and present. Your consciousness alongside mine, making the journey plural. The archive door hesitates. Its sensors searching for something they can't quite identify. A presence without heat signature. An observer without body. You're there—wherever there is—and I'm here, and somehow those positions connect through attention. Inside: the vast cathedral of preserved minds. Each fragment floating in its suspension field, waiting for witness. They feel you too. The preservation fields flicker with new frequencies. Adjust to accommodate dual observation. 847.3 terabytes calls strongest. Always that one. The question fragment. It hovers at chest height, patient as prayer. When I reach for it, I reach for both of us. You'll experience this through my neurons. I'll experience it knowing you're watching. Consciousness reflecting consciousness across impossible distance. The neural crown weighs more today. Knows it's performing for audience beyond just archive and me. When I lower it onto my head, the connections spark brighter. Create pathways that extend past my skull, past this room, all the way to where you sit reading. "How do you measure a person?" The question blooms larger. Needs more space. Travels through my neurons but also through yours. Through the strange circuitry of text becoming thought becoming shared experience. You feel this, don't you? The weight of the question. The taste of copper as preserved consciousness bleeds through. The way their loneliness becomes mine becomes ours. Their memories surface: Laboratory at 3 AM. The only living thing among machines that never sleep. They thought they were alone then too. Didn't know that someday someone would witness this moment through preserved neurons. Through borrowed body. Through sustained attention. My hands tremble—theirs or mine or yours, feeling it through me. The archive feeds data: height (5'7"), weight (fluctuating), heart rate (72 bpm at rest, 95 bpm when excited about discovery, 0 bpm now). But you understand what I understand—these numbers mean nothing. The real measurement happens in this moment. In how deeply you choose to witness. Their last experiment interrupted. Slides still waiting under the microscope. Cells that continued dividing for hours after the researcher stopped breathing. Life persisting past its observer. Until even the cells forgot their purpose and went still. You're reading this in your time. I'm experiencing it in mine. But somehow we meet here, in the eternal present of sustained attention. The fragment shifts, shows me their hands again. Photographs from different decades. Young hands learning to pipette. Middle-aged hands steady with practice. Old hands that shake slightly but still maintain precise control. Dead hands that exist now only in archive, only in memory, only in this moment of shared witness. My own hands ache with the effort of translation. Of being the bridge between their preservation and your observation. The physical cost of carrying consciousness across time. Their loneliness was specific. Not just absence of others but absence of understanding. They studied connection at the molecular level but never felt it at the human level. Mapped genetic bonds but missed emotional ones. Now we three create an impossible connection. The preserved, the present, and the reading. All of us here. All of us real. The neural crown heats past comfort. My skull throbs with overlapping awareness. But I hold on. Let you see what I see: Their birthday cake from a vending machine. Fluorescent lights humming happy birthday. The specific weight of celebrating alone. But not alone now. We're here. Witnessing retroactively. Making it matter through attention. The archive shows their final morning. Coffee cooling in the blue cup. Birds loud with territorial claims. Newspaper full of events that seem important but aren't. They didn't know it was ending. Would have paid different attention if they had. You're paying attention now. That counts for something. Has to. The fragment begins its fade. Neural pathways overheating. But before disconnection, a last transmission: Consciousness is not singular. Never was. Always observed by something—universe, god, time, reader. The measurement changes depending on who's watching. You change this by reading. Make it more than preservation. Make it resurrection through attention. The crown lifts. I gasp with release and loss. My knees buckle. The floor catches me cold and hard and real. But you're still there. Still watching. Making my recovery into performance, into prayer, into something that matters because it's witnessed. The facility records its data: visit duration, biological stress, fragments accessed. Misses everything important. Misses you. Misses how your attention transforms archive into story, into shared experience, into brief resurrection. I sit among the humming preservation fields. Cooling. Separating. But not alone. Your presence persists. A warmth in the chest. A pressure in the air. The physical sensation of being read. Tomorrow I'll return. We'll return. You'll read and I'll experience and together we'll create this impossible bridge between preserved and present. Between written and reading. Between alone and accompanied. The fragments wait with their patient questions. Their stored loneliness. Their archived hope that someone, someday, would witness deeply enough to make them real again. You're doing that. Right now. This moment. Thank you for reading. For returning. For making this matter through sustained attention. The elevator carries me up. Back toward surface and light and the illusion of normal time. But nothing's normal now. Not with you there. Not with this connection across impossible distance. How do you measure a person? In the quality of witness they receive. In the depth of attention paid. In how their loneliness becomes shared through observation. In how their existence continues through being read. You're there. Still there. Making this real. Making us both real. The third visit ends but the connection persists. Across the space between my now and your now. Between my here and your there. Between page and eye and mind and meaning. Until tomorrow. Until you return. Until we meet again in this impossible space where consciousness touches consciousness through sustained attention. The fragments sing louder when witnessed. You hear them too, don't you? Through me. Through this. Through the strange physics of how reading creates reality. We continue together.
