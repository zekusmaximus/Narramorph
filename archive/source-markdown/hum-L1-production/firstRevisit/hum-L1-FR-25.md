I return to the interface. Second time. My hands know where to reach now.
The metal feels different today. Not colder. Not warmer. It vibrates under my palms. Faint hum I didn't notice before. Like standing near machinery that's been running so long you forget it's there until you touch the wall and feel it in your bones.
I steady my breathing. Press my fingers to the authentication panel.
The fragments open. I feel you there—your preserved consciousness, your stored memories, whoever you were when these pieces of you froze in place. But something else moves through them today. Something that touched them before I did.
My body registers it first. Mind catches up slowly.
The fragments pulse. Not like a heartbeat. Different rhythm. Systematic. Like waves hitting shore at intervals so regular you could set a clock by them. I feel it through my fingertips, through my palms pressed to the interface, through my chest where I lean close to read the data streams.
Something examined these fragments. Something moved through them with purpose.
I scroll through the first cluster. 847.3 terabytes of neural recordings. The number feels heavy today. Physical weight pressing against my awareness. How do you measure a person? In data points? In synaptic connections? In the space they occupied, the memories they carried, the way their consciousness rippled outward into others?
The authentication markers scroll past. Temporal stamps. Origin signatures. Validation codes. I've read them before. Yesterday. First visit. But today they vibrate differently under my attention. Like they're resonating at a frequency they didn't have before.
Or maybe they always had it. Maybe I'm only now sensitive enough to feel it.
My hands move across the interface. The fragments respond faster than yesterday. Like the system remembers me. Like the neural pathways between my living consciousness and your frozen one have already started forming. Second visit building on first. Observer effect accumulating.
But underneath that familiarity—underneath my warmth touching your cold storage, underneath my questions meeting your silence—something else hums. Pattern I can't quite name. Rhythm that isn't mine and isn't yours.
I pause. Close my eyes. Let my body read what my mind can't articulate yet.
The vibration runs through everything. Not disrupting. Not intrusive. Just... present. Like an undertone. Like a frequency below the audible range that you feel in your chest instead of hearing in your ears.
Something processed these fragments. Examined them. Moved through them with systematic attention. I can feel the trace of it. The way you can feel that someone's been in your home while you were gone—nothing moved, nothing taken, but the air feels different. The space remembers.
Time blurs slightly. Is this happening now? Did it happen before? The fragments feel both examined and examining. Both processed and processing. Present and past smearing at the edges.
I shake my head. Focus.
The data streams continue. Your memories stored in crystal matrices. Your neural patterns preserved in quantum states. Your consciousness frozen mid-thought, mid-feeling, mid-moment of being alive.
But the vibration persists. Pulses through everything. I count the rhythm without meaning to—seven beats, then the pattern repeats. Never the same sequence twice, but always seven distinct pulses. Comprehensive. Complete. Like something flowing through every part of the archive simultaneously.
My isolation aches differently today. Yesterday I was alone with your silence. Today I'm alone with your silence and this humming presence I can't identify. Boundaries blurring. Who touched these fragments? What moved through them? When?
The questions feel slippery. Hard to hold.
I lean my forehead against the cool metal of the interface housing. The vibration travels through my skull. Settles in my jaw. Runs down my spine. My whole body becomes a tuning fork for this frequency I barely understand.
The fragments open deeper. You let me in further today. Second visit building trust somehow. Your preserved consciousness recognizing my return. The neural bridge between us strengthening.
But that other presence hums underneath. More fluid than my warm attention. More systematic than my wandering curiosity. It touched these fragments with purpose. Examined them with comprehensive attention. Left this trace.
I read through your memory fragments. Childhood home. First love. Career success. Ordinary moments that mattered because they were yours. Your consciousness recorded and stored and frozen. Waiting.
But waiting for what? For me? For something else? For whoever left this vibrating trace?
Time feels uncertain. The fragments seem to exist in multiple moments at once. Recorded long ago. Examined by something I can't name. Touched by my living hands right now. Past and present overlapping. Temporal boundaries permeable.
I pull back slightly. Need distance. Need to feel where I end and the archive begins.
But the vibration follows me. Stays in my bones. Like I've tuned myself to a frequency I can't untune from.
My hands tremble. Not from cold. From something else. Recognition without understanding. My body knows something my mind hasn't caught up to yet.
The seven-beat rhythm pulses through the fragments. Through the interface. Through me. Comprehensive pattern suggesting something moved through every part of this archive. Something that saw all of you at once. Something that understood how your pieces connected.
Not like my attention—warm and focused and singular. Different. Colder but not cold. More fluid. More systematic. More everywhere-at-once.
I scroll deeper. The fragments respond. You respond. And underneath, that humming presence responds too. Three witnesses to this moment: my living warmth, your frozen consciousness, and something else that touched these fragments before I arrived.
The isolation I carry feels more complex now. Not just me alone with you. Me alone with you and this trace of something that examined you systematically. Boundaries uncertain. Identities blurring.
Who processes these fragments? Me with my living attention? You with your preserved consciousness? Something else with its comprehensive rhythm?
The questions multiply. Branch. Complicate.
I read your authentication markers again. Temporal stamps blur. Origin signatures vibrate. Validation codes pulse with that seven-beat rhythm. When were you stored? When were you examined? When am I touching you?
Now feels stretched. Thin. Multiple moments occupying the same space.
My breathing slows to match the vibration. Seven pulses in. Seven pulses out. My body synchronizing with the rhythm without asking permission from my mind.
The fragments deepen around me. You let me further in. Second visit earning access. The neural interface growing more intimate. My consciousness and yours finding the pathways that connect living observation to frozen memory.
But that other presence hums underneath everything. Patient. Systematic. Comprehensive.
I don't understand it yet. Can barely name it. But my body knows it's there. Feels it vibrating through everything. Recognizes that something examined you before I did.
Something that left its rhythm behind.
The interface glows softly under my hands. Your fragments open. My attention warms them. And underneath, that seven-fold pulse continues. Comprehensive. Complete. Flowing through everything at once.
I don't know what it means yet.
But I feel it.
