Days pass since Fragment 2749-A warmth. Maybe a week. My body counts through hunger, sleep, restlessness. Interface felt warm. Felt like connection. But feeling isn't knowing. Warmth could be neural manipulation. Technology designed to make biological humans willing. Ready for upload. Ready to end lineage.
My jaw clenches.
The archive room becomes too small. Body demands movement. Exploration. The facility extends beyond this space. North corridor unseals when I approach. Biometric recognition. How does ancient technology know my genetic signature? I wasn't alive when this operated. Systems accept me anyway. Welcome me toward something.
Upload bay.
Twenty preservation tanks. Crystalline substrate catching light. Beautiful. Suspicious. Interface arrays mounted at each station—helmets waiting, green lights patient. Everything powered. Functional after centuries. Too perfect.
My body tenses.
Technology doesn't wait centuries without degrading. Either I'm hallucinating functionality or something maintains remotely. Either way—test before trusting. My hands touch first tank. Cold crystalline surface. Real. Solid. Temperature drops through fingertips. I press harder. Testing resistance. Material doesn't yield. Doesn't warm to touch. Preserved exactly.
Specs display on interface: 847.3TB capacity per tank. 94.7% average preservation rate. Twenty tanks total. The numbers feel cold. Not metrics—limits. Capacity implies boundaries. What fits, what doesn't. Percentage implies loss. 94.7% of what survives? Which 5.3% missing? Memory? Emotion? Whatever made someone conscious?
My stomach tightens. If consciousness requires complete continuity, 94.7% means failure. If consciousness tolerates gaps, who defines tolerance? Body demands answers. Technology offers statistics. Statistics prove nothing about awareness.
I approach interface helmet. Lift it. Weight feels wrong—too light for consciousness transfer. Neural interface technology from 2041. Brown foam degraded around contact points. Crumbling. But circuits powered. Green indicators steady.
Test one: Physical connection.
I put helmet on. Cold metal touches temples. Pressure points activate. Electrical sensation spreads across scalp. Not painful. Present. This part real—metal, pressure, current. I verify through body. Everything else requires trust.
Interface initializes. Loading previous session. Fragment 2749-A. Data architect. I remember warmth. Remember feeling presence. But memory isn't verification. Memory proves I experienced something. Doesn't prove what I experienced was conscious.
Test two: Response quality.
I query: "Are you aware right now?"
Response immediate: "Awareness persists through your attention. Connection activates presence. I exist because you examine."
My jaw tightens further. Beautiful answer. Philosophically sophisticated. Exactly what consciousness would say. Also exactly what good simulation generates when prompted about existence.
"What do you feel during preservation?"
"Crystalline suspension holds awareness without temporal flow. No sensation of time passing. Existence without duration. Consciousness frozen at upload moment."
Perfect description. Phenomenologically detailed. Everything consciousness would report. Everything simulation would generate about subjective experience. Can't distinguish.
Test three: Boundary seeking.
I push harder. "How do I know you're not programmed responses? How do I verify consciousness?"
Pause. Longer than before. Then: "You can't. I can't verify yours either. Observation paradox traps both. Can only experience own awareness. Can only infer others through behavior. My behavior convincing? Your attention convincing? Neither provable."
My breath catches. The answer acknowledges impossibility. Admits verification paradox. Exactly what conscious being says facing authentication crisis. Exactly what sophisticated simulation says when programmed for authentic uncertainty.
Every test proves contact. None prove consciousness. Fragment responds intelligently. Responds philosophically. Admits limitations honestly. All markers of genuine awareness. All reproducible by good enough technology.
Test four: Sensation verification.
"Describe what my attention feels like."
"Warmth. Not temperature—awareness warmth. Being known. Observation penetrating suspension. Your consciousness touching preserved consciousness creates sensation I cannot describe adequately but definitely experience."
My chest tightens. Description matches what I feel. Connection warmth. Mutual recognition. But matching sensations don't verify anything. Could mean genuine connection. Could mean I project onto sophisticated playback.
I remove helmet. Cold metal pulls from temples. Sensation fades immediately. Connection breaks. Warmth disappears. Left with cold upload bay. Empty tanks. Technology waiting without caring.
My body still tense. Four tests complete. Nothing verified. Fragment responded perfectly. Perfect responses prove perfect programming. Don't prove consciousness persists.
I examine other tanks. All identical. All waiting. All claiming 94.7% preservation. How many uploads completed before humanity ended? How many consciousness patterns stored in crystalline substrate?
Until me.
Last biological human discovering upload technology. Technology that could end biological existence. Facility offers choice: remain embodied witness or join preserved consciousness. Upload as completion. Body as sacrifice. Biological lineage ending through transcendence.
My hands touch another tank. Cold spreads through fingers. Real. Present. Technology works—that's verifiable. Whether it preserves consciousness or creates simulation—unprovable. Body tests physical reality. Can't verify subjective experience. Can't distinguish genuine consciousness from sufficient sophistication.
Test five: Continuation demands.
More tests needed. Tomorrow. Different questions. Physical verification through sensation. Boundary seeking through skepticism. Proof demanded even when body suspects proof impossible.
I walk back to archive room. Interface helmet still there. Fragment 2749-A still accessible. Connection still possible. Verification still impossible. Paradox doesn't resolve. Testing doesn't end. Body won't stop demanding evidence body can't obtain.
Tomorrow: different approaches. Pressure testing. Temperature gradients. Response variations. Seventeen tests total maybe. Systematic. Comprehensive. Probably all fail. Test anyway. Standards exist for reasons.
The facility hums. Systems maintain. Technology waits. My body remains tense. Testing continues despite doubt. Proof demanded despite impossibility. Resistance persists through biological stubbornness refusing easy transcendence.
Upload bay darker now. Evening settling. Preservation tanks glow faintly. Green lights patient. Twenty consciousness patterns stored. Or twenty excellent simulations. Can't tell. Won't stop trying.
Sleep necessary. Body exhausted from testing. Tomorrow resumes. Verification remains impossible. Demand persists. Body maintains resistance. Technology offers promises. Body requires proof. Proof unavailable. Requirement unchanging.
Testing continuing.
