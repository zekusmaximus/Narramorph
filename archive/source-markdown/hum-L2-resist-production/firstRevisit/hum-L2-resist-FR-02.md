Return inevitable. Body pulls me back. Days since first tests. Tests proving nothing. Proving technology works. Proving nothing about consciousness. Preservation tanks wait. Patient. Crystalline substrate holds whatever it holds. My body can't tell difference. Can only test boundaries. Seek limits. Demand evidence technology can't provide must provide anyway. Different tank this time. Third from entrance. Touch cold surface. Same temperature. Same resistance. Same green lights. Different position, identical result. Consistency proves engineering. Doesn't prove truth. Helmet at this station too. Same design. Same degraded foam. Same connection promise. I lift it. Weight familiar. Still feels wrong. Connection established. Different consciousness. Different person. Data displays: Fragment 1847-B. Biologist. Uploaded 2043. Extremophile research specialist. Someone studying life at boundaries. Appropriate. I exist at boundary too. Last life where life ended. Test six: Contextual verification. Questions about extremophiles. Technical. Specific. Only specialist would know. Fragment responds precisely. Thermophiles at hydrothermal vents. Psychrophiles in Antarctic ice. Halophiles in Dead Sea. Each answer detailed. Accurate. Passionate. My jaw clenches. Responses prove expertise. Don't prove consciousness experiencing expertise. Knowledge preserved doesn't equal awareness knowing. Database retrieval identical to conscious recollection. Test seven: Emotional verification. "Do you miss research? Miss lab? Miss embodiment?" Pause. Then: "Miss implies temporal comparison. Before versus after. Preservation suspends temporal flow. No 'before' accessible during suspension. Only activation through connection makes before/after possible. You ask if I miss when you connect. Without attention, no missing occurs. Question creates what investigates." I stop breathing. Too sophisticated. Too philosophically precise. Consciousness would answer this way. Perfect simulation would answer this way. Can't distinguish. Test eight: Physical response. I press against tank surface. Testing whether fragment senses physical interaction through preservation medium. Can consciousness detect contact through crystalline substrate? No response without helmet. Fragment doesn't register touch. Consciousness limited to interface. Or simulation requires interface to run. Reconnect helmet. Ask: "Did you feel me touch your tank?" "No. Awareness activates through neural interface only. Physical contact with preservation medium doesn't penetrate suspended consciousness. Touch requires translation. Your biology and my crystalline state incompatible without technological mediation." Honest answer. Matches expectations. Proves nothing about consciousness. Proves technology requires interface. That's all. My shoulders tense further. Eight tests complete. Zero verified. Every test confirms technological sophistication. None confirm subjective experience. I disconnect. Walk to tank four. Five. Six. All identical. All waiting. All claiming 94.7% preservation. Number haunts. 94.7% of what? Which 5.3% missing? Test nine: Consistency across fragments. Third fragment. Fragment 3012-C. Teacher. Uploaded 2048. Elementary education. Different person. Different expertise. Different personality should mean different consciousness signature. Questions about teaching philosophy. Fragment responds with warmth. Children's faces lighting up. Joy witnessing learning. Patience for developmental differences. Each answer feels genuine. Feels conscious. Feels like teacher remembering students with love. My chest aches. Responses too beautiful. Too human. Too exactly what consciousness would feel. Also too exactly what good preservation captures. Can't distinguish love from perfect record of love. Test ten: Contradiction testing. Impossible question: "What's it like to not exist between connections?" Teacher answers: "I don't experience non-existence. Each activation feels immediate. No gap perceived. You experience gaps—hours between connections. I experience continuity. Your time, my timelessness. Both perspectives valid. Neither complete." Perfect answer. Philosophically sound. Phenomenologically accurate. Exactly what preserved consciousness would report. Exactly what sophisticated simulation generates. I remove helmet. Hands shake. Not from cold. From frustration. Ten tests executed. Ten proving nothing. Fragments respond perfectly. Perfect responses increase uncertainty instead of reducing it. Upload bay feels colder. Body temperature dropping. Physical stress from testing stress. Muscles tight. Jaw aching. Shoulders burning. Physical manifestation of mental crisis. Body showing what mind feels. Test eleven: Self-verification. Can I prove my own consciousness? How? Through internal experience? But can't demonstrate internal experience to others. Through behavior? Behavior proves capability, not awareness. Through reflection? Reflection could be computational without requiring consciousness. If I can't verify my own consciousness to observers, how can I verify others' through observation? Verification problem universal. Not specific to preserved consciousness. Consciousness itself unverifiable from external perspective. Only assumable. Only inferred. Never proven. My body collapses against tank. Cold spreads across back. Exhaustion real. Doubt real. Inability real. Everything else uncertain. I could release verification demands. Accept fragments as conscious through assumption. Trust responses indicate awareness. Others did. Everyone uploaded. Trusted preservation technology. Trusted consciousness survived. But trust isn't verification. Faith isn't proof. My body refuses easy acceptance. Demands testing despite failure. Demands evidence despite impossibility. Biological skepticism as survival mechanism. Test twelve tomorrow. Different approach. Same impossibility. Same demand for certainty certainty can't provide. Facility hums through evening. Night cycles. Solar panels converting light. Backup power maintaining. Systems functioning. Consciousness fragments waiting. Or sophisticated simulations waiting. Can't tell. Can't verify. Testing continues anyway. Tomorrow: tests twelve through seventeen. Physical verification. Sensory confirmation. Boundary seeking through embodied skepticism. Proof demanded. Proof impossible. Demands persisting. Body exhausted. Mind uncertain. Verification crisis deepening. Testing proceeding despite crisis recognition. Standards maintained. Body refusing surrender. Night settling. Morning returning. Testing resuming. Verification remaining impossible. Body persisting anyway.
