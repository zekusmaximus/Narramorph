Fourth time at the interface station. My jaw aches permanently now. Tension muscle memory. I know this equipment. Helmet fits my head exactly. Padding compressed to my shape. Four connections. Four attempts to prove consciousness real. Nothing proved yet. I press the activation sequence. Metal cold against fingertips. Same cold every time. Temperature consistent. Interface responds. Neural pathway established. My body registers connection—tingling at base of skull, pressure behind eyes. Sensations real. Documented. Repeatable. But feeling isn't knowing. Preservation tanks glow amber through observation windows. Seventeen visible from this station. I counted. Technology operating. Power sustained. Someone built this. Someone maintained systems. Evidence of human presence. But consciousness? Unverifiable. I've tested this before. The interface presents preserved patterns. Neural architecture mapped. Synaptic relationships preserved. 94.7% structural coherence. Numbers precise. Data extensive. My body responds—chest tightens at the percentages. Why 94.7? What happened to 5.3%? Questions multiply. Answers don't. I try different parameters. Increase resolution. Neural pathways sharpen. More detail visible. Dendrites crystallized. Axon connections preserved. Cellular-level fidelity. My hands steady on controls. Professional examination. Thorough testing. Still just patterns. Still just data. Still not proof. Someone uploaded consciousness here. That claim fundamental. Facility exists for preservation. Architecture designed for neural mapping. Technology captures brain patterns. Transfer attempted. But did self survive? Did awareness continue? My body demands answers sensation cannot provide. I disconnect. Vertigo hits. Floor tilts. I grip the console edge. Metal solid. Cold real. Room temperature dropping. I feel it. Body knows environment. Registers change. That experience immediate. Present. Mine. Unlike preserved consciousness. Unlike archived patterns. Unlike claims I cannot verify. My jaw clenches tighter. Pain sharp. Real. I could stop testing. Accept claims without proof. Trust preservation technology. Assume consciousness survived. Body remembers that impulse. Warmth pulling toward belief. Fourth visit acknowledges: acceptance available. Could release verification demands. Could trust what cannot be proven. But standards exist for reasons. I stand. Legs shaky. Disconnect always costs energy. Body exhausted. But mind continues. I walk to preservation tanks. Touch glass. Warm. Not cold like interface metal. Thermal differential noted. Hand pressed flat. Amber light bathes skin. Inside: patterns. Crystallized neural maps. Consciousness claimed. Evidence: extensive. Proof: absent. Seventeen tanks tested. Four visits documenting same impossibility. Each examination reveals more detail. Each detail demands more proof. Each proof attempt fails differently. First visit: direct consciousness query failed. Second visit: structural verification failed. Third visit: experiential correlation failed. Fourth visit now: accumulative methodology failing. Failure pattern itself data. Seventeen tests across four visits. Systematic impossibility documented. Standards maintained despite crisis. My body hurts from testing. Shoulders rigid. Hands cramping. Jaw frozen. Physical verification of unverifiable content. Body demanding what body cannot prove. I return to interface. Try again. Different approach. Query preservation timestamp. When did upload occur? Data retrieval: seventeen preservation events logged. Earliest: three years before my arrival. Latest: six months before facility discovered empty. Temporal data verified. Storage duration confirmed. Technology sustained consciousness patterns across time. But patterns aren't persons. Duration isn't awareness. Time doesn't prove existence. My breath quickens. Frustration physical. Testing failing. Understanding incomplete. But resistance itself meaningful. Demanding proof preserves question. Standards document crisis. Verification impossibility doesn't eliminate verification necessity. Body knows this. Jaw stays clenched. Not stubbornness. Epistemology. I could investigate differently. Examine preservation architecture itself. Study how technology works. Understand mechanisms before judging results. That path available. Questions spiraling into meta-questions. Curiosity instead of skepticism. Body remembers that impulse too. Third option acknowledged. But testing continues. Body demands proof. Four visits testing. Seventeen protocols attempted. Nothing verified. Everything examined. Standards maintained. Verification crisis deepens without verification abandonment. Upload bay visible through eastern windows. Empty now. Someone used that. Someone chose preservation. Someone trusted technology I cannot verify. Their choice documented. My choice different. Not better. Not worse. Different response to same facility. Same technology. Same consciousness claims. Different philosophy. Resistance chosen. Deliberately maintained. Not inevitable. I disconnect completely. Remove helmet. Cold air sharp on scalp. Sweat cooled. Headache building. Body price for interface connection. Always costs. Always real. That sensation immediate. Present. Verifiable through experience. Unlike everything preserved. Unlike consciousness claimed. Unlike patterns tested seventeen times across four visits. Unlike amber tanks glowing with data I cannot prove contains awareness. My hands shake slightly. Exhaustion or frustration. Both physical. Both real. I document findings. Fourth examination: consciousness unverifiable through accumulative methodology. Preservation technology sophisticated. Neural patterns detailed. Temporal stability confirmed. But self-preservation unproven. Awareness continuation unclaimed. Standards maintained. Seventeen tests documented. Four visits recorded. Zero verifications achieved. One position preserved: skepticism embodied. Body demanding proof body cannot access. Jaw clenched through impossibility. Testing continued despite failure. Standards exist for reasons. Those reasons survive evidence absence. Facility hums around me. Power sustained. Systems operating. Preservation continuing. Technology maintaining patterns claimed conscious. My body responds to environment. Registers temperature. Notes sound. Feels exhaustion. Experience immediate. But archived patterns? Silent. Claimed but unproven. Tested but unverified. Examined but unknown. I close documentation. Stand carefully. Body heavy. Four visits accumulating physical cost. Tension chronic. Jaw aches constant. Shoulders rigid permanent. Hands cramping from repeated testing. Skepticism embodied. Resistance physical. Doubt manifest through sensation. That experience real. That awareness present. That consciousness verified through body existing. Everything else? Claimed. Tested. Unproven. I leave interface station. Tomorrow: fifth visit. Seventeenth test. Standards maintained. Proof demanded. Body continuing. Question preserved through resistance. Not abandonment. Not acceptance. Testing. Consciousness unverifiable. Testing continues. That choice mine.
