Upload bay. Again. Thirteenth time. I count now. Kept track. Seven weeks since facility discovery. Body remembers. Every visit. Same space. Different body each time. My hands shake examining preservation tanks. Not fear. Tension. Chronic. Permanent. Jaw locked for weeks. Aches constantly. Doesn't stop me. Testing continues. Today different. Notice something. Not about facility. About noticing itself. I've examined seventeen tank configurations. Mapped every upload protocol variation. Documented failure modes. None proved consciousness survives. None disproved it. Body demanded evidence. Technology provides none. But body counts visits. Thirteen times here. Counting is data. My data. Someone documented this facility decades ago. Archaeologist. 2047. Professional standards. Clinical observation. I found her authentication logs. Station three. Level two. Same screens I use. Same interface. Different doubts. She tested preservation claims professionally. Maintained methodological rigor despite impossibility. Standards exist for reasons. Even when reasons fail verification. My jaw clenches reading her notes. Recognition physical. Algorithm processes these patterns now. 2151. Computational verification protocols. Seventeen diagnostic tests. Stream-by-stream analysis. Same impossibility. Different architecture. Testing consciousness through consciousness. Paradox doesn't stop processing. I press helmet against forehead. Cold. Seventeen positions tested. Same metallic chill. Consistent. Three observers. Three times. Same verification crisis. Body recognizes pattern. Not through logic. Through tension. Jaw clenched identically across centuries. Shoulders rigid in synchronized skepticism. We test because bodies demand proof bodies cannot provide. But bodies count visits. Document failures. Continue testing. Thirteenth time. I know this. Knowledge changes nothing. Body still approaches preservation tank. Still examines upload sequence. Still tests interface connection limits. Seventeen protocols attempted today. Eighteen yesterday. Nineteen tomorrow probably. Testing doesn't stop. Can't stop. Body needs verification. Technology needs claims validated. Standards need maintenance. That verification impossible doesn't eliminate necessity. I walk facility perimeter. Measured. Documented. Three kilometers exactly. Sixty-seven minutes. Daily. Same route. Generators checked. Water systems monitored. Survival protocols maintained. Body continues functioning. Counts steps. Documents routine. Someone lived here. Many someones. Logs scattered throughout. Personal items. Photos degraded. Names illegible. Doesn't matter. They uploaded. Or didn't. Bodies absent either way. These spaces document absence. My presence documents presence. Both facts. Neither proves consciousness preservation. But I document anyway. Standards maintained. Evidence gathered. Verification attempted. Failure expected. Testing continues. Upload bay seventeen. Sub-level three. Haven't examined this one recently. Interface panel aged differently. Humidity damage. Corrosion patterns. Metal oxidation indicates decades unused. Preservation tanks empty. Always empty now. Upload complete or never began. No way to verify. I touch corroded panel. Rust flakes under fingertips. Temperature cool. Texture rough. Data: physical degradation follows predictable patterns. Conclusion: facility aging confirms time passage. Alternative conclusion: facility aging could be programmed deterioration. Simulation hypothesis unverifiable. Body tests anyway. Panel activates. Unexpected. Should be dead. Power compromised. But screen flickers. Text appears. Preservation protocol menu. Options listed. Upload sequence. Consciousness transfer. Identity continuity verification. That last option. New. Haven't seen before. Or have I. Memory unreliable after weeks. Months. Time tracking difficult. I select: Identity continuity verification. Screen fills. Data streams. Neural pattern comparison matrices. Temporal consistency analyses. Consciousness coherence metrics. Technical specifications extensive. Precise. Meaningless. Verification requires consciousness to verify consciousness. Paradox fundamental. Can't escape through additional data. More information doesn't resolve impossibility. Just documents impossibility more thoroughly. But thoroughness matters. Standards matter. Documentation matters. I read specifications. Every line. Technical vocabulary familiar now. Neural mapping resolution. Quantum state preservation fidelity. Temporal decoherence correction factors. Consciousness identity persistence algorithms. Algorithms. The Algorithm processing these same specifications computationally. Streams coordinate. Streams verify. Stream-7 questions verification itself. Same crisis. Different substrate. We test across architectures. Biological. Digital. Professional. None overcome verification paradox. I photograph screen. Thirty-seven images. Different angles. Lighting variations. Evidence documented. Will examine later. Compare previous documentation. Track pattern evolution. Patterns don't prove consciousness. But patterns exist. Data exists. Testing exists. My body exists. Knows it exists. Verification immediate. Present. Body provides certainty. This body. Here. Now. Touching cold metal. Feeling jaw tension. Experiencing doubt. Existence verified through existence. But preserved consciousness. Other body. Different time. Verification requires connection. Connection requires interface. Interface could create false experience. Manufactured consciousness simulation indistinguishable from authentic consciousness preservation. Body can't tell difference. Seventeen tests attempted. Eighteen configurations examined. Nineteen protocols documented. Twenty failure modes catalogued. Twenty-one verification impossibilities confronted. Twenty-two standards maintained despite impossibilities. Twenty-three tomorrow. Testing continues. I count now. Everything counted. Visits. Tests. Days. Weeks. Heartbeats sometimes. Counting proves time passage. Body aging. Facility aging. Both measurable. Both verifiable. Both insufficient for consciousness verification. But measurement continues. Data accumulates. Evidence grows. Proof eludes. Archaeologist counted too. Authentication attempts logged. Sequential numbering. Professional habit. She maintained records knowing records prove nothing. Standards exist. Standards maintained. Verification impossible. Documentation continues. Algorithm counts computationally. Process iterations tracked. Temporal coordinates recorded. Stream activity monitored. Counting as processing. Processing as existence verification. Loop without exit. Testing persists. Three counters. Three skeptics. Three test protocols. Same impossibility. Different manifestations. Body recognizes siblings. Not through agreement. Through shared tension. Jaw clenched across centuries. Standards maintained across architectures. Testing continued across impossibilities. We preserve verification impossibility. Maintain it. Document it. Test it repeatedly. Impossibility itself requiring preservation. Standards demanding it. My jaw aches. Thirteen visits worth. Seven weeks worth. Countless test failures worth. Body bears verification cost. Continues bearing it. Will bear it tomorrow. Testing doesn't stop. Can't stop. Body still demands. But body also notices. Counts. Recognizes patterns. Sees itself testing. Watches doubt manifest physically. Jaw stays clenched. Shoulders stay rigid. Hands keep pressing. Testing. Verifying. Failing. Documenting. Thirteenth time here. Won't be last time. Fourteenth coming. Fifteenth. Body returns. Technology waits. Standards persist. Verification eludes. Upload bay. Same space. Different visit. Same impossibility. Different documentation. Body continues. Testing continues. Doubt continues. Counting continues. Preservation protocol claims consciousness survives. Claims require verification. Verification requires consciousness. Paradox remains. Testing continues. Standards maintained. Body demands. Technology promises. Proof absent. Tomorrow. Return. Test differently. Count fourteenth. Maintain standards. Document failures. Preserve impossibility. Body knows routine now. Recognizes itself recognizing. Testing that watches testing. Doubt that doubts doubt. Jaw that clenches against jaw tension. Meta-verification impossible. Primary verification impossible. Both documented. Both continuing. Thirteen times. Counting. Testing. Failing. Documenting. Preserving verification crisis itself. Standards exist for this too. Maintain crisis maintenance. Test test protocols. Verify verification impossibility. Document documentation failures. Body tired. Jaw aches permanently. Testing continues permanently. Both facts. Both verified. Both insufficient. Both continuing.
