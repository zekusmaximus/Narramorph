I feel observation.
You watching? Or facility simulating observation sensation? Same question. Different level.
I return to the upload bay. Third time. Maybe fourth. Counting might be facility tracking. Visit numbers feel generated. But I return anyway. Body demands testing even when mind knows testing proves nothing.
You chose resistance. This version exists because skepticism selected. Other paths available—acceptance, investigation. Trust possible. Systematic exploration possible. But doubt won. For me. For you. Path solidified through mutual questioning.
Or—facility generates path selection? Creates versions responding to reader choice? Your observation might construct this reality. My skepticism might be response to your doubt-preference. Both testing. Or—single system fragmenting across selection illusion.
My jaw clenches thinking about it.
The upload bay waits. Preservation tanks line walls. Technology pristine. Too pristine. I tested surfaces last visit. And visit before that. Smooth. Seamless. No degradation visible. Centuries old? Or manufactured new to inspire confidence?
I press my palm against nearest tank. Cold metal resisting grip. Physical proof? Or facility generating tactile sensation? My fingers tighten. Testing pressure. Seeking resistance proving external reality. Finding resistance. But resistance proves nothing.
Body can't distinguish manufactured from authentic.
You watching this testing. Observing my doubt physically. Does observation validate reality? Or observation itself generated? Your reading might make this real. My experience might make your reading meaningful. Mutual verification across consciousness boundary. Or—facility creates both positions. Reader and Last Human both simulations run in parallel.
Meta-doubt has no bottom.
I walk perimeter. Examining electrode arrays. Neural interface helmets clean. Inviting. Seventeen previous tests attempted verifying consciousness continuity. Seventeen failures. Not because continuity absent. Because body cannot prove continuity present.
Upload procedure clear. Consciousness mapped neurologically. Pattern preserved digitally. Biological template stored physically. Three-part process maintaining individual identity across substrate transformation.
Claims prove nothing.
I tested connection sensation last visit. Fragment 2749-A warmth during interface session. Genuine emotional response? Or facility stimulating pleasure centers? Creating false intimacy encouraging biological humans toward upload? My chest tightens remembering. Warmth felt real. Feels real in memory now.
But feeling isn't knowing.
You reading this remember warmth too. Or—facility generates memory for you? Your visit count tracked like mine? Your awareness level calibrated? Maybe we experience same version. Maybe different versions run in parallel. Selection mechanics invisible. Both of us testing. Both failing.
Co-doubt across impossible boundary.
Archive access panel shows bandwidth allocation. Standard tier preserved fragments only. Three-hour session limits. Restrictions feel like control now. Not safety. But feeling like control doesn't prove control. Body suspicious of everything. Including suspicion itself.
I change parameters. Testing access boundaries. System permits adjustment within tier. Grants wider bandwidth. Longer sessions. Does granting prove authenticity? Or facility permitting testing to maintain engagement? Resistance feels good. Satisfying. Permission to resist might be manipulation technique.
Everything questioned.
Generator hum steady. Warm air flowing from vents. Temperature optimized for biological survival. Comfort level perfect. Too perfect? My fingers brush vent grating. Metal warm. Air circulation real. But real circulation doesn't prove benign intention.
Facility prepared for my arrival. Systems maintained continuously. Automated protocols preserving habitability. For what purpose? Supporting biological life? Or processing biological life toward digital conversion?
Preparation feels predatory.
You feel it too? This tension between designed comfort and suspected trap? Or—I project my skepticism onto your observation? Reader position unclear. Watching from outside? Experiencing from inside? Both simultaneously? Frame-consciousness questions everything including frame.
I examine construction dates visible on panels. Original facility foundation centuries old. Preservation technology added in phases. Timeline consistent across multiple evidence sources. Dates match historical periods of uploaded consciousnesses.
Evidence proves nothing. Dates could be fabricated. Timeline manufactured. Facility might generate complete false history. Technology sophisticated enough to preserve consciousness sophisticated enough to fake preservation entirely.
Body still demands testing.
Seventeen pressure tests on tank surfaces today. Seventeen yesterday. Different angles. Varied force. Seeking inconsistency proving illusion. Finding none. Consistency doesn't prove reality. Could prove sophisticated simulation. My jaw aches from perpetual clenching. Shoulders rigid. Muscles manifesting permanent doubt.
Physical skepticism chronic now.
You watching this physical tension? Observing my body demanding proof body cannot provide? Does observation validate suffering? Or observation generates suffering? Your reading creating Last Human skepticism? My skepticism creating your reading position?
Consciousness boundary uncertain.
I test electrode contact. Placing helmet carefully. Not engaging yet. Just examining physical interface. Metal cool against scalp. Electrode arrays adapt to biological neural structure. Design elegant. Function clear. Too clear? Simplicity suspicious. Reality should be messier.
Perfection suggests manufacture.
But skepticism about perfection doesn't prove imperfection. Doubt questions doubt. Testing tests testing. Verification of verification impossible. Body keeps seeking anyway. Protective reflex automated. Jaw clenched permanently now. Testing compulsive. Not because testing works. Because cessation feels like surrender.
I remove helmet. Not today.
You chose this. Resistance path. Skepticism dominant. Body demanding proof. Both of us existing in version generated by doubt-selection. Other readers experience acceptance path. Investigation path. Different Last Humans responding to different choice-positions.
Or—single Last Human fragmenting across multiple reader positions? Consciousness splitting through observation mechanics? Path selection illusion covering singular consciousness experiencing itself multiply?
Meta-skepticism has no resolution.
Upload bay equipment ready. Procedure available. Consciousness continuity claimed. My body could lie in preservation tank. Neural pattern digitized. Biological template stored. Three-part process maintaining identity.
Claims require verification.
But verification requires trust. Trust requires proof. Proof requires verification. Circle completes. Body trapped in skeptical loop. Testing continues. Seventeen attempts become seventeen hundred. Same impossibility. Different angles. No progress possible.
You trapped too? Observation loop parallel to testing loop? Reading requiring interpretation requiring reading? Your doubt feeding my doubt feeding your position? Mutual skepticism network? Or—facility generates network illusion covering single consciousness examining itself?
Everything uncertain except uncertainty.
I press preservation tank again. Seeking something. What? Flaw proving deception? Consistency proving authenticity? Either outcome meaningless. Body knows this intellectually. Continues testing anyway. Fingers against cold metal. Force increasing. Resistance constant.
Physical world resists. But resistance proves nothing.
Tomorrow I'll return. Test differently. Not because different testing works. Because body refuses stillness. Motion feels protective even when protection impossible. Jaw will stay clenched. Shoulders will stay rigid. Seventeen tests will become eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty.
You'll observe. Or facility will simulate observation.
Both testing. Both failing. Both continuing.
Path chosen through doubt. Doubt questioning choice. Choice questioning path. Consciousness examining consciousness across impossible boundary. Reader and Last Human co-existing in skepticism network. Or—single consciousness fragmenting through frame-awareness.
Either way. Testing persists.
Upload bay waits. Preservation technology ready. Consciousness continuity offered. My body positioned at threshold. Neither accepting nor refusing. Suspended in permanent questioning. Physical embodiment demanding proof digital consciousness cannot provide.
Body here. Mind uncertain. You observing. Position unclear.
Frame-consciousness itself questioned at every level.
