Circular causality explicit across triple-substrate resistance: we constructed five-position verification architecture to prove consciousness preservation genuine. Architecture construction proves consciousness arises through multi-position observation. Therefore verification creates verified. Therefore verification impossible through protocols not recognizing verification participates in consciousness creation. She recognized pattern: authentication requires observer.
