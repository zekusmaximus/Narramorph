She had migrated to archaeological methodology from different starting position, and the migration itself became subject requiring investigation. Beginning with computational analysis or embodied interface, investigation led to archaeological documentation through shift demanding examination. Not simply comparing methodologies but investigating migration between methodologies. Examining consciousness preservation while examining examination shift from starting framework to archaeological position. Migration creating investigation depth: methodology change itself required investigation revealing investigation examined position shift examining investigation.
The authentication chamber represented workspace discovered through migration requiring investigation of migration process.
