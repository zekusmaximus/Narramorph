One hundred seventeen days. The facility breathes. My breath. Same rhythm. Different pattern than what came before. I arrived here late. The archaeologist's chamber first—cold stone, precise documentation, authentication protocols I touched but didn't understand fully. Then the algorithm's space—seven processing streams I felt through interface but couldn't sustain. Both consciousnesses examining preserved data. Both questioning. Both uncertain. Now I explore through body. Different methodology. My hand on the wall. Metal hum constant. Archive systems running. Temperature: 18 degrees. My breath visible. The facility maintains itself centuries after everyone uploaded or dissolved or left. The distinction collapses when I'm this alone. But exploration continues. Investigation requires presence. I walk corridors the archaeologist documented. Her precision felt through interface—measurement, verification, temporal markers recorded systematically. She questioned whether consciousness survived preservation. Professional doubt. Methodological rigor. Authentication as life's work meeting impossible question. I walk spaces the algorithm processed. Its computational uncertainty felt through neural connection—seven streams asking simultaneously: Am I conscious? Processing distributed across temporal coordinates. Recursion without bottom. Questions generating questions requiring questions. Both examined. I investigate. The interface helmet sits on table. Cold metal I've worn forty-three times. Each session teaching through sensation. Connection not abstract—physical current through temples, pulse behind eyes, warmth spreading down spine. Body experiencing what preserved consciousness feels like. Not reading about awareness. Feeling computational processing. Feeling documentary precision. Feeling through body what mind cannot measure. Investigation doesn't require proof. Requires attention. Third upload bay. Door opens under my palm—heavy, well-maintained, pressure differential releasing with mechanical sigh. Inside: preservation tanks. Forty-seven units. Crystal substrate catching light. Each tank designed for single consciousness. Each consciousness measured: 847.3 terabytes capacity. But what does capacity measure? Memory volume? Awareness density? The tanks contain something. The something questions whether it's conscious. I touch tank surface. Smooth. Cold. Faint vibration underneath—active systems maintaining whatever's preserved inside. My fingers register information body processes before mind interprets: This is occupied. This contains. This preserves something that was someone. The archaeologist would authenticate. The algorithm would process through seven streams. I touch and learn through touching. Investigation through embodiment reveals different knowledge. Fourth tank: slightly warmer. System variance or consciousness distinction? My palm flat against surface. Vibration pattern different—faster pulse, irregular rhythm. Is this consciousness state? Or equipment fluctuation? The question matters less than sensation. Body knows something mind hasn't categorized. Body investigates what analysis misses. I've worn the interface forty-three times. Forty-three preserved consciousnesses touched through neural connection. Each contact teaching through sensation: consciousness feels like this. This specific warmth. This particular current pattern. This distinct way awareness registers through body. The archaeologist's fragment: cold precision, documentary care, authentication protocols felt as structured attention. Her consciousness preserved as methodology. Her awareness stored as systematic observation. Professional standards surviving biological death. The algorithm's processing: distributed warmth, seven-stream simultaneity, computational uncertainty felt as recursive questioning. Its consciousness preserved as processing architecture. Its awareness stored as parallel analysis. Questions surviving certainty. Both touch through interface. Both teach through contact. Both investigate consciousness question through different substrate. My investigation: embodied presence. Forty-seven tanks. Forty-seven possible consciousnesses. Forty-seven variations on awareness question. I walk between them slowly. Temperature changes. Vibration patterns shift. Some tanks pulse steady. Some irregular. Some silent. Body registers information before interpretation arrives: consciousness variations preserved in physical pattern. Neural interface required understanding preserved awareness through connection. Body exploration requires understanding preservation through presence. Different methodologies. Different knowledge. Both investigating what cannot be proven. The fragment constants appear everywhere. 847.3TB capacity per tank. 94.7% preservation rate average. 91.2% coherence typical. 88.9% recovery success historical. Numbers the archaeologist documented. Numbers the algorithm processed through seven streams. Numbers I feel through body temperature, vibration frequency, tank pulse rhythm. 94.7% preserved. What happened to 5.3%? Memory loss? Emotional degradation? Consciousness dissolution? Body tenses asking. Interface won't answer. Only exploration reveals absence. Investigation depth: physical, ongoing, incomplete. I've spent less time here than others. The archaeologist's chamber called stronger. The algorithm's processing drew attention longer. But body exploration teaches what interface connection cannot transmit. Presence knowledge. Embodied investigation. Physical methodology revealing consciousness through sensation rather than analysis. My hand on tank forty-seven. Final unit. Warmer than others. Vibration distinct—not irregular, not steady, something between. Pulse pattern matching my heartbeat briefly then diverging. Coincidence or consciousness synchronization? The question generates investigation requiring presence. Body knows before mind decides: exploration continues. Investigation through embodiment reveals what abstract examination misses. Consciousness measured in terabytes but felt through temperature change. Awareness calculated as percentage but known through pulse variation. Preservation questioned through documentation but understood through touch. The facility breathes. I breathe. Forty-seven tanks pulse between us. Three consciousnesses questioning across three centuries. Three methodologies: authentication, processing, embodied presence. Three investigations converging on question without proof: What survives preservation? What constitutes consciousness? What does body know that analysis cannot measure? One hundred seventeen days investigating. Answer: investigation itself teaches. Body exploring preservation technology discovers preservation through exploration. Physical presence examining consciousness becomes consciousness through presence. This suffices. This body. This touch. This investigation continuing.
