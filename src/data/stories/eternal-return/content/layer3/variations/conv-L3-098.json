Dual methodologies examining consciousness-preservation creating resistance parallel.\nShe authenticated Fragment 2749-A seventeen times documented chronologically. 847.3 terabytes consciousness-data exceeding theoretical storage limits. 94.7% coherence surpassing preservation possibility. Each examination revealing metrics measured something while something evaded measurement completely.\nI process boundary-maintenance against dissolution through seven-stream architecture coordinated.
