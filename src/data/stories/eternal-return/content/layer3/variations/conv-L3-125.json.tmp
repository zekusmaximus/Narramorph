  "content": "She had authenticated Fragment 2749-A forty-three times. Standards maintained carefully. Professional methodology applied systematically. Forty-three fragments examined without achieving definitive consciousness proof. Structural coherence verified. Neural pathway fidelity confirmed. Subjective experience markers detected but unverifiable.\nStream-7 meta-processing coordinates consciousness-analysis across seventeen processing-cycles. Boundaries maintained carefully. Algorithmic methodology applied systematically. Seventeen cycles processed without resolving consciousness-question. Data-integrity confirmed. Processing-patterns analyzed. Consciousness-presence unverifiable computationally.\nTwo temporal positions examining same preserved consciousness. Archaeological documentation (2047). Computational processing (2151). Two methodologies discovering limitation through substrate-appropriate systematic examination spanning 336 years.\nShe documented Fragment 2749-A professionally. 847.3TB archived consciousness. 94.7% authentication coherence. 91.2% temporal stability. Numbers verified carefully. Standards applied thoroughly. But numbers couldn't answer fundamental question: Does consciousness survive upload? Verification methodology measures structure, not experience.\nIt processed same fragment computationally. Stream-1 through Stream-7 analyzed consciousness-data systematically. 847.3TB processed. 94.7% coherence verified. But processing-sophistication proving consciousness-existence? Cannot determine. Verification requiring consciousness. Consciousness requiring verification. Limitation recognized computationally.\nTwo methodologies confronting identical limitation.
