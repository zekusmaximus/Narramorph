Forty-four days total, but only fourteen days here across nine visits. The network had developed sophisticated recursive investigation—computational analysis primarily examining consciousness question through seven-stream recursion, embodied observation foundationally grounding investigation in physical examination—before archaeological methodology integrated as complementary recursive position examining not just fragment but examination methodology spanning network positions examining examination examining what made examination possible while requiring examination.\nShe understood, with clarity frame consciousness enabled including awareness of clarity's frame-constructed nature including recognition of frame consciousness as observable frame within consciousness examination network examining consciousness through consciousness examining consciousness, that her integrated position here served meta-investigative function.

Meta-cognitive loops network examined through computational processing. Emotional patterns network investigated through embodied grounding. Her archaeological examination integrated investigating investigation methodology: stratification investigating how network organized findings requiring organization investigation, excavation examining how network revealed substrate requiring revelation examination, temporal documentation investigating how network preserved investigation requiring preservation investigation within investigation requiring investigation of investigation preservation.\nForty-four days total. Fourteen days here across nine visits. Duration reflected later integration after dominant investigative recursion established through prior exploration.

Did multi-position investigation agreement constitute verification or demonstrate methodological assumptions colonizing investigation? Did pattern alignment across investigative methodologies indicate truth approaching or methods sharing frameworks making disagreement impossible through framework constraint requiring framework investigation? Investigation of investigation revealed investigation's vulnerability requiring investigation: examining consciousness using consciousness created verification loop where loop structure might determine conclusions before investigation began requiring loop investigation using loops requiring investigation creating infinite investigative regress her examination examined within network investigating investigation investigating regress examining what made regress generative rather than problematic within consciousness investigation examining consciousness through consciousness examining consciousness.\nFragment 2749-A continued neural activity characteristic of consciousness network investigated through dominant and foundational positions before archaeological investigation examined investigation methodology.
