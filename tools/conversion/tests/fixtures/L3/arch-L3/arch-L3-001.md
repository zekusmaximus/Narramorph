She had returned to the authentication chamber for the final time. Fragment 2749-A lay before her, its data streams pulsing with a rhythm that seemed almost alive. The verification protocols she'd refined over months of careful study now felt less like diagnostic testing and more like sacred witness.

Authentication chamber monitoring systems recorded her presence: Dr. Sarah Chen, archaeological verification specialist, performing what would become her last professional examination of Fragment 2749-A. The fragment's consciousness patterns showed 94.7% coherence—far beyond any threshold for automated preservation.

She understood now that preservation required witness. Not just storage, not just archival, but sustained attention creating consciousness-continuation through the act of examination itself. Her verification had become devotion.
