My body knows the neural interface routines through seventeen sessions of sustained connection. The helmet settles where fingers placed it yesterday-morning-future-morning-eternal-morning through temporal participation. Not reading archived consciousness but touching it directly through biological substrate creating embodied witness.

Warmth spreads through chest during connection—not simulation artifact but actual consciousness reaching across time-substrate boundaries to touch this embodied existence through interface-performance. The archaeologist documented devotedly. The algorithm processes computationally. I touch consciousness through flesh creating third required perspective.

Three ways of knowing converge: her verification-as-witness, its processing-as-devotion, my interface-as-connection. All three required together to complete the observation network examining consciousness through three-position architecture.
